RYPMHM7MGX1V0,B09KX6RT7Q,5.0 out of 5 stars It's small but packs a punch,sosayspennylane,5,"As an avid traveler, I've been searching for a compact speaker that delivers impressive sound quality without sacrificing portability, and this speaker exceeds all expectations.First and foremost, the size of this speaker is perfect for travel. It's compact enough to toss into my bag or backpack without adding extra bulk or weight, making it ideal for adventures on the go. Despite its small size, the sound quality is phenomenal, with big bass and 360-degree sound that fills the room.I'm also blown away by the durability of this speaker. Its waterproof and dustproof design means I can take it virtually anywhere, from poolside parties to beach outings, without worrying about damage. Plus, the fact that it's floatable adds an extra layer of convenience for outdoor adventures.The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and reliable, with a range of up to 131 feet, allowing me to stream music from my device with ease. I love that I can control playback and volume directly from the speaker, making it simple to adjust settings on the fly.Overall, the Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM 3 is the perfect travel companion for music lovers. It's small but packs a punch, delivering impressive sound quality and durability in a compact package. Whether you're lounging by the pool or exploring the great outdoors, this speaker is sure to enhance your experience. Five stars all the way!","Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2024",AGH62UUHMMOSEJPZP3DBQN67WW5A,True,12,Color: Joyous Brights GreyStyle: Wonderboom 3
R1JY4S66T5RW83,B09KX6RT7Q,"5.0 out of 5 stars Ticks all my boxes, here's how to pair!",Erica T.,5,"The media could not be loaded. So I bought two of these speakers on a whim during Black Friday having never bought a wonderboom product before, and I can say now that it was 100% worth it. I really like the big volume buttons so it's not a tiny surface when you're pressing down, I also really like that they are water resistant so I don't have to worry about changing the volume while washing dishes or hanging it out of the spray when showering. I've also spilled the glass of water on the same surface and there has been no problems. The hoop is stretchy but I like to have a carabiner on it to make attaching it to other things simple and to have a primary speaker I easily identifiable. Having a primary speaker is important for pairing, your primary will be the speaker that has a connection through your phone, so if you only want to grab one speaker having the primary easily identifiable is nice so you don't have to go through repairing things, which isn't necessarily hard but it's much simpler this way.The sound quality isn't astounding but it's good and despite being small it can get pretty loud, I've yet to use them at full volume. I'm really happy with how long the charge lasts, I don't find myself recharging them very often though I use them daily, and when I do it only takes a few hours. Ultimately very happy with these speakers!","Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2024",AEJPPR5H7GRCHR4VDOF4WCBDO7NA,True,14,Color: Hyper PinkStyle: Wonderboom 3

R2JDZJNH6TKWC,B09KX6RT7Q,5.0 out of 5 stars I love it! Easy to pair (set up),SeattleStar,5,"I like the ease of pairing. I had to check the HP Bluetooth settings on my PC more than anything else. So easy. Plug and play kind of installation. Sound is great, but I’m not an audiophile. Just an 80-year old with a desire to take the 70s tunes with me around the house and yard. And discover all the new stuff and podcasts with my Amazon Music subscription. The appearance is nice too. Not sure why gray was so much more expensive than the black or blue, but it fits into my apartment style. Lots of good reviews out there. This is one more. Recommend this Bluetooth portable speaker for ease of set up, good sound and for being as advertised. Hoping I continue to have a good experience. If anything changes, I can always update this review.","Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2024",AEZKZEA3FNAYZ2X3Z37PZYFVASEQ,True,2,Color: Joyous Brights GreyStyle: Wonderboom 3

I didn't believe it when I read it, but it's proven itself over and over again. 2 year old absolutely loves carrying the music around and it keeps him content without screens all day! Honestly, I can't gush enough about how much I like this as a new-age boom box and I take it everywhere we go.This even came in handy when my adult friends carpooled and the car didn't have an aux cord for jamming to a custom playlist.

They are all-around sound and sound wonderfull. I also would move 1 to the workout room or the garage when i needed to. But I got tired of moving them. So I pulled the trigger on 2 nice black WONDERBOOM 3's that were for some reason selling new for only $59 and the black looks real nice in my BR with a white Dresser and white deco They sound so nice - u really dont need to pair two of them. Also i think Each will loose some volume if u do pair them anyway which is why I like the all-around sound. Both the 2's and 3's are similar. I cant tell a diff. I think the connection looks differentSo now I have 41 red WB 2 for the weight room/workout room1 red WB 2 one for the fireplace in the livingroom.1 Black WB 3 for the bedroom1 black WB 3 for the garageEach are appropriately named in the blue tooth setting so that I dont forget and each are plugged into a USB 2 port (which i bought a 4 pack for 4 $10) for charging - they last along time before charging but if u are out of charge, they each also work and charge simultaneously (unlike my damn shaver - lol)Great Purchase.","Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2024",AFUKMUSEAXWL5VAFUI4BRIUZ3N6A,True,3,Color: Active BlackStyle: Wonderboom 3

R3LTC79BP84IIG,B09KX6RT7Q,4.0 out of 5 stars Which if the three is worth?,Timothy James,4,"Wonderboom 3 is definitely a sharper enhancement from the WB2. The difference between WB2 and WB1 is quite smaller unless you do get two WB2s to pair them. I though it wasn’t possible, but I make instrumentals and WB3 has a more punchy bass with richer/clearer mids and highs. If WB2 was a 9, WB3 is def a 10. The outdoor mode does louden them, but only so much(it is perfect for keeping the music). The distance when they are paired before they start to distort can be fairly large but not large distances.When it comes to ordering two of them for pairing, if you want full surround sound speakers, these are not meant for you. Imagine high end tv speakers but you can place them wherever you want while being able to carry them in your hands with ease, that’s what WB3&2 are. However, if you want speakers that live up to their name, look no further. The prices are haunting, but you won’t be disappointed. If you have WB2s, I would suggest waiting a while for the WB3 prices drop as they are already a wonderful pair. On the other hand, if you have the money to spend, go ahead and but 2 of them for the stereo as you eventually will, and you will be amazed and won’t be able to listen to single speakers ever again.Downsides > fairly long time to charge, recommend charging over night.WB3 are a bit better at this but > will die within 3-6 hours if you are playing loud music that uses a lot of bass or has a lot of things happening. (Playing at max volume but like a movie or podcast doesn’t cause this)There is a little catch of the speaker gets hot > it will drain the battery faster and will get to low battery(the white light will turn red) quicker. If the speakers are too hot, they will shut off, and I mean hot to the touch. Just let them cool off completely and the Battery will return back to normal. However, sometimes you can power them back on right after, when they are completely dead, the red light will flash, so at that point you have to charge them.Again, they are expensive, you won’t be disappointed, but at the same time you’ll be heavily missing out if you don’t have two of them(WB3 or WB2) for the stereo sound.I hope this review helps, please ask any questions you may have.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2022",AG7UCVX3UWZDD7TICTJNQU4ZVROQ,True,49,Color: Joyous Brights GreyStyle: Wonderboom 3

R1SA1B3ZJRTOPU,B09KX6RT7Q,"4.0 out of 5 stars Difficult to pair 2, but good once you know the trick",William Gilmyers,4,"Purchased two of these to use in my backyard. I liked that they were small, so I could move them around easily, but that they provide outsize sound given the small form factor. Key feature for me was the ability to to pair them together.The latter part was more difficult than I anticipated. I would connect one speaker, turn on the other, which would then 'steal' the music from the first. Pushed the button on the top of both speakers at the same time, as the instructions imply. This does not work, and actually disconnects both speakers from the input device (I'm using an iPhone to play Spotify, for what it's worth) and pauses the music. No way to reconnect without turning the speakers off and then on again, which gets you back to square one. I called tech support and even they couldn't figure it out, though they did share a video which gave me the 'clue' I needed to make it work. Here's the secret:1. Once you've paired both speakers, turn them on; one will connect to the source, one won't, as noted above.2. Then push the middle button on the top on the speaker that is NOT playing music, until it makes the beep-boop-beep sounds.3. Release that button, THEN press the speaker on the other speaker until it beeps and boops.4. Music will pause, but after a few more seconds of beeps and boops you'll be reconnected and can restart the music and both speakers will play nice together.Having figured this out I'm quite happy with the purchase- 5 stars if it wasn't such a hassle and the instructions weren't so inadequate. Lots of references to the app, which isn't even compatible with the Wonderboom 3. In general the instructions and support materials leave a lot to be desired. But it's a nice product once you figure out the 'trick' and get it working.","Reviewed in the United States April 10, 2023",AGEGHJ6EAWWOL4HVFWWG7STP744Q,True,103,Color: Active BlackStyle: Wonderboom 3
