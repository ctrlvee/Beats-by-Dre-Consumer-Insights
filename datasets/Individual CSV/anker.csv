R18JW4G8BDMSX1,B0BXW4KKXK,"5.0 out of 5 stars The Marvelous, Magnificent Microdot!",space kiddet,5,"I needed these speakers to compensate for the classic conundrum clash, consumers have little choice to choose between the splendidly superb & spectacular 10-bit color as well as the crystal clear clarity (e.g.) the 32"" class Samsung Q60A panel versus its anorexic sound due to contemporary esthetics in addition to the unprecedentedly bizarre clause in our apartment that bars bringing in items unless brought by the owner! which precludes me from having to pass up more appropriate $300-$400 soundbars! Nevertheless, I hope I solved the sound issue scourging modern tellies!Out Of Box ExperienceUpon delivery via one of my siblings On Wednesday 27th December 2023, I was impressed with the brawniness of the boxes as well as the Rubix cube-style, Matryoshka doll challenge exclusively to open it up which began with an outside sleeve which introduced its newly minted owner to the speaker's attributes in polyglot languages; then came the sleeve separating the two levels of cellophane wrap as well as the foam which looks to be a half-inch thick holding the 2.3' USB-C to C cable designed to be used with a wall charger, a Safety & 10 page Quick Start pamphlets, @ the top there's a UPC, the International Environmental & Radio regulationatory agencies this device has to conform to before being approved for sale on the global markets. Finally, at the bottom, a serial number UPC!ConstructionThis Motion X600 consists of a three-part fabrication; a handle & grill forged from aluminum on the front with a color-coordinated plastic posterior available in ""Polar Black"", ""Lunar Blue"" and ""Aurora Green""upon visual inspection is difficult to discern where the aluminum metal ends & the plastic begins! Meanwhile, the handle has respectively, ""Spatial Harmony"" & ""High Fidelity Audio"" in block font along the bottom left & right ends of the handle as well as ""Soundcore"" in stylized lettering on the top right. The ridges that aid grip-ability are located in the bottom middle part while the perimeter periphery is smooth. Staying in the back has a unique rubber stop flap which guarantees the X600 its Ingress Protection Level 7 status that enables the speaker can handle H2O from misting & condensation up to an accidential dunk up to a meter for 30 minutes. the rear also conceals a passive radiator, linked to the Midrange ""Sky Driver"" but helps the system sound better via Digital Sound Processing, a USB-C port as well as a 1/8"" auxiliary jack.Driver ConfigurationThe Anker Soundcore Motion X600 Speaker System is a 3-way, quintuple driver powered by 5 amplifiers producing 10-watt RMS for a total of 50 watts RMS configured as twin 2.06"" woofers, duo 1.06"" tweeters & a unique 1.92"" passive radiator augmented midrange ""Sky Driver"" Spatial Driver is controlled by a 12 core Intel i7 12700K processor clocked from 3.6-5.0 GHz, ohm: N/A, Frequency Response: 48-40,000Hz+- 2.84dB, Horizontal Dispersion, 5.49dB, Signal to Noise Ratio: 72dB, Total Harmonic Distortion: <1%, Sensitivity, 92.1dB, Crossover: 54Hz, 2,500 Hz & 19,100Hz, Battery, SW-34MP2S2P; 6400mAh Dimensions: 6.25"" High x 11.75"" Wide x 3.88"" deep, Weight: 5.17lbs.I charged my first Motion X600 with a 45watt Samsung wall charger connected to a 100watt Anker cable taking 4.5 hours to charge while the 2nd X600 was charged using an Anker 30watt wall charger with a second 100watt cable connected to two of the 8 electrical outlets which was done in 5 hours.When both speakers completed their compulsory charging session, on Thursday, December 28th, 2023, most of the scribes advised switching on both the Spatial Audio & Bass Buttons to mitigate its mettle as well as promote the prowess of the Motion X600 otherwise owners would likely feel the engineering savants were snookering them impacting future sales.Eargasmic Ecstasy!That began when I decided to play my 450-song Latino 🎄Carols playlist on YouTube Music designed to tide me over a 13-hour journey from Gastonia, North Carolina to Philadelphia! Once I activated, the 15-segment equalizer, the Spatial & Bass buttons It was 😱WOW!!!, WOW SQUARED!!!!!!, WOW CUBED!!!!!!!!!! 😲 It was as if I heard the music for the first time! for it sent chills through my body to not just the 🦴s but the bone marrow! Which is exactly how good the X600s are! Sibling #6 was as duly impressed with the speakers as he was with my Q60A panel when was deployed 21 months ago! for he considers them Home Theater caliber!This was confirmed on Three Kings Day/Epiphany; January 6, 2024, when after still trying to use the Soundcore app to no avail, it was not only severing The True Wireless Stereo bond but replaced the X600 pairing with the generic LG driver on the TV which necessitated a speaker reset so in despair, I watched ""Terminator; Judgment Day"" & realized how good the X600 sounded as normal solitary speakers when I could readily discern where the various soundtrack aspects occurred via the individual speaker drivers! Once I reset the speaker it started at maximum volume which almost got us reported by the next-door neighbors for bringing the noise! After a successful reset, and recharge (for 7 & 8 hours) which for an idiosyncratic orientation, included playing the YouTube playlist, I watched & thoroughly enjoyed the lush, vigorously robust soundtrack of ""Wonder Woman 1984"" & Quite honestly, What I heard through my 👂holes brought me back to when I had my last CRT, The NEC 2030S & my first LCD panel, the Samsung LN-T1954 when TVs had enough space to include decent stereo sound to match their displays!The Soundcore AppIt's an authentic atrocity that this program is oriented toward audio music when the Motion X600 itself can adapt itself to Audio/Video Home Theater & worse yet when I called Anker Innovations Tech Support on January 2nd, they confirmed its bias toward record collections because every time I endeavor to utilize its features, it shut down the TRUE WIRELESS STEREO facet which is the reason why I strived to save the >$200 more to score the second speaker! which rendered the other speaker as mute as a mime, furthermore, the app caused more agita by making it more problematic to pair with my Samsung Q60A panel! I sincerely wish and desire that this Cucaracha is finally fumigated from future updates ASAP! STAT! In addition from December 28th, 2023, when I first tried to establish a legitimate Soundcore Account it wouldn't recognize it even though I followed the procedure precisely to the letter!ConclusionI'm happy that the operation of these Anker Soundcore Motion X600 speaker systems isn't dependent upon this program because they sound incredibly amazing, augmented by its uniquely innovative design & technologies both external & internal, its configuration and price. And the President Grant-sized discount on top makes it even more of a steal of a deal!Addendum: Monday 12 February, 2024One of my pet peeves with my pair is that I had to sync it with the YouTube Music account before working successfully with my panel; for the past month after subsequent charging sessions, that weirdness has vanished. Both speakers hook up normally, provided that the owner/operator powers them in the proper sequenceAlso, I acquired the 45-watt Anker 313 wall charger for the 2nd speaker to have them fully charged & ready at the same time enhancing my satisfaction with these speakers.","Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2024",AHR2HVADX4IGRM7V267GYCXJMM5Q,True,15,Color: Black
R1THO542WOEKRY,B0BXW4KKXK,"5.0 out of 5 stars Easy to carry, excellent sound and power!",ddz,5,"I bought a pair of Anker buds a couple of years ago and have been super happy with their sound and the function of their app/bluetooth connectivity, so when I wanted a home bluetooth device, I knew I wanted Anker. I am SO happy with this purchase!!The sound is AMAZING, the retro-yet-modern old school radio styling is super sleek and attractive, and it is easy for me to carry around the house (I have a 2 story townhome) thanks to the handle. I love the speakers on all sides -- it really has power and fills big rooms with clear, crisp sound. It does run down a charge fairly quickly, but charges relatively fast. I never have any issues connecting to my phone or with signal droppage and the app is user friendly and allows you to adjust sound -- it is my favorite purchase of the past year and I use it constantly.","Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2024",AEC6ZQFS6UO5WTINL46LGZ2YVYJQ,True,2,Color: Blue (Lunar Blue)
R2YABD856Q74QN,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Love it when my expectations are exceeded,GDS,5,"As soon as I turned on these speakers, my ears were happy. I've had several speakers from Bose and other brands over the years, but these speakers take the prize. They are beautifully designed and engineered, and the sound is rich and spacial with a balanced sound. Bass is perfect, not too much, not to little, for listeners who are not into booming their music and unlike so many other speakers that overdo the bass. The app works very well to equalize the sound. Ramping up the volume does not distort the music. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.Soundcore stands by their products. A few weeks ago I bought a pair of Soundcore earbuds that sounded great, but they malfunctioned in a few days. Through the app I requested warranty service and 2 days later the company shipped me a new pair of earbuds.This brand has great products at the right price. I'm sold.","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2024",AHUL6RFSCI26BFX3TC3LVIQ55ANA,True,1,Color: Black
R3IPNT575ZDTWH,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Sounding Bluetooth Speaker for under $200,Mac Geek,5,"I own MANY bluetooth speakers. Bose, Harman Kardon, Alexa Echo, other SoundCore and Apple to name just a few. This is the best sounding speaker at this price point! Great full sound and lots of bass. Very high quality material. Also it looks as good as it sounds. Even at half power, it louder and (and sounds better) than the other speakers I have at full power. It really fills the room with a huge sound stage giving you rich full sound. The spatial audio feature on Apple Music sounds amazing, you will hear instruments in a song you maybe have heard a hundred times for the first time in Spatial Audio. The built in handle makes it very easy to carry around with you and it is still small enough to toss in your weekend bag or your beach bag to take the music with you on the go. I just wish the handle was foldable to make even more compact in your bag.Pros:Lots of bang for your buckBuilt in spatial audioBass boostAmazing sound stageCustomizable EQGreat looking designCons:Non foldable handleBattery is 12 hour battery but can take up to 6 hours to rechargea tad on the heavy side compared to other same sized speakersThe cons are not big and I do not think they would be enough to keep anyone from buying one","Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2024",AFESPPS76OCDJS5TFP5FNZYE6FPQ,True,19,Color: Black
RI9EV9603R8U0,B0BXW4KKXK,4.0 out of 5 stars The other reviews are not joking!,Jerry Kindall,4,"The most important thing about any Bluetooth speaker is the sound. I am rather picky with audio quality and most products need some tweaking to meet my standards, and some can't meet them at all. This unit has very good sound, especially at close range. It turns up pretty loud, too (to fill a room you only need to turn it up to the second or third notch) and does a fine job outside when cranked up sufficiently. Of course the louder you play it, the shorter the battery life.The pairing is easy; just turning it on for the first time activated pairing, and my Pixel phone immediately recognized it without me even having to choose it in the list of devices available to pair. That process prompted me to install the app as well. Very slick.The app is good and has some unexpected nice features (for example, you can play/pause whatever app you're using to actually play music from the Soundcore app, so you don't have to keep switching back and forth). It feels more polished than the one LG provides for its XBOOM Bluetooth speakers, for example.The default ""Soundcore Signature"" equalization curve is good, and shows off the speaker's capabilities nicely, but you can also tweak the equalizer however you like. When you turn up the treble it's really there, sounds natural and not tinny or distorted. Same with the bass, which is solid and not boomy. It's not one of those bass enhancer things that uses psychoacoustic principles to give the impression of more bass; it's really there and it can rattle the table.As far as i can tell, the EQ and spatialization features are functions of the speaker itself; the app is not doing the audio processing on the phone, just changing the speaker's features. So once you have the speaker set up the way you want, you could remove the app. Speaking of the spatialization, it's reasonably effective at close range but if you're across the room from it, it doesn't do much, as you might expect. I haven't tried spatial audio on it, though, just stereo.This product shows a pleasing thoughtfulness and attention to detail all the way around, from build quality to the app to the sound. On Prime Day the price was certainly right and I'm glad I pulled the trigger.","Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2023",AGIY3WBHRMCHOY2SY2527UBYGZWA,True,44,Color: Black
R3MHT3B4OBZW54,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Quality Speaker,@SteveG,5,"I had bought Anker ear buds last year which were excellent for the money so when I was looking and saw this speaker with a $50 coupon and high ratings, I pulled the trigger and ordered it without much thought. Being a musician who usually takes about 3+ months of research to buy any piece of audio equipment, this was a big step for me LOL.All I can say is that this speaker has been great so far. It's a very cool, clean, modern looking speaker. The construction feels solid and durable and having the handle to carry it around from place to place is more of a plus than I thought it would be. The sound quality is excellent, bass is very good at low to medium volumes but gets lost a bit when you really turn it up (or that could just be my aging ears), and it is loud! I didn't notice any significant distortion at high volumes and the overall clarity and presence of the individual instruments was very good. I tested a variety of musical genres (jazz, rock, pop, punk, ska, hip hop, rap, classical) and all sounded good to great.The Anker app is great and gives you more flexibility with the EQ settings as well as showing the battery level of the speaker. The voice prompt when you power on/off isn't obnoxious like some other speakers I've heard, it's just a tone but you can also turn it on and off in the Anker app. Since I already had the app for my earbuds, I just needed to add the speaker to my devices in the app (click of a button) and I was good to go.The battery life seems solid. It does take a while to charge fully (about 6 hours) but from what I read you can charge while using it in a pinch, but you shouldn't do that all the time or it can cause damage to the battery. I tend to listen at a fairly loud volume most of the time and after listening to music for about 4 hours using the BassUp and Spatial features on, the battery level is still showing as about 60%-65% so I'd expect to get about another 6-8 hours before I have to recharge.In short, I am very happy with the speaker and would definitely recommend it. I am definitely considering getting a second to have stereo pairing.","Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2024",AE5C6NE3B7256J6VUL7XGRKF2HXQ,True,36,Color: Black

However, you can get a very good Bluetooth speaker. It too me a bit t choose on this one. The outside it is built like a tank. No plastic for main parts. The keypad works very well. The handle does not move which I see is a minor problem. The. Sound is very amazing. It punches above its weight there. The Spatial sound as well a base response is excellent.both have a switch to turn each on and off. There is a App that handles a lot, but especially the EQ. It has several profiles already and you can also make your own. It was a good price during Prime Days. Also, you can run two ofthem the way the. App is set up.

R1ENJU3Y5FRBPB,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Punches way above its size and price point,JD,5,"I got the Soundcore Motion X600 for $150, at the time there was a $50 off coupon which they seem to do occasionally.I am not crazy deep into audiophile stuff but I enjoy good sound quality. I own several pairs of Sennheiser headphones and the quality of the Soundcore seems comparable to the best of them in my opinion, of course it is a speaker not a headphone. One of the reasons I got this was so my wife would have a speaker to play stuff through and I wouldn't have to listen to a tinny iPhone speaker struggling for dear life.I thought the spatial audio thing was a gimmick but it's like some sort of magic. You have to hear this speaker in person to believe it. Online video reviews don't do it justice.Music is balanced and crisp. Listening to a podcast is like the host is right in the room with you talking. It's amazing.Other pros include having an AUX input for redundancy and better quality than Bluetooth (although even on Bluetooth this speaker sounds great). I like that it's waterproof so I can take it outside or keep it around when doing home renovation projects and not worry about my speaker. Battery life is great, and in my experience I get more than the stated 12 hours, which may be due to some of my use being at a low volume (playing instrumental music on my desk during the work day).This speaker looks sleek too! Very pleased with my purchase after using it the past two months and hoping it continues to last.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFJKOMGEIB3AWZGJQPG72JWJMUIQ,True,5,Color: Black
R1G6ONY83BAE6Z,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Speaker of the year,Theodore Teich,5,"Ok well. I've had the bose 900, the klipsch rives, the Sonos Beam gen 2....looking for something that could give new life to music. As an audiophile once told me ""If it doesn't make you want to register to all your favorite music then it isn't the right equipment for you.""I agree. I wanted something that could sound could in an apartment but still give me depth and width and clarity. After watching a lot of youtube reviews I took the plunge.I was ready to be not that impressed, especially having had all the equipment listed above and and not finding an emotional connection to music through them.Well Sonos and Bose can suck it. This little speaker is better tuned for clarity than any of them and the dsp to simulate spatial audio is A+. I listened to tons of music 80s and 90s rock mostly. The clarity is very good and vocals come up out of the top speaker. I was astonished to hear guitars separated out in 3d.You will want to be in a square room with the speaker in the center so the spind bounces off the walls.I'm really thinking about negating a second to create a stereo pair. But honestly even just 1 speaker sounds amazing.It really makes me wonder why anyone pays for Bose or Sonos. I have annadrpid and you use the LDAC and youtube music and it sounds great.If Soundcore ever makes a soundbar I will probably buy it. Although I did you this to watch Manhunter on Amazon and paired it to my tvs bluetooth. Voices where clear and the soundtrack was awesome.It's really rare to be happy with a bluetooth speaker imo. And at this price the quality was unexpected. I think if you like the idea of spatializing your music than this is a no trainer.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AF6FX4IODKBJTPTIHCE2CQDNKMZQ,True,0,Color: Black
R33JV6LWCYQ6UT,B0BXW4KKXK,4.0 out of 5 stars Good but not good enough,Joey Kot,4,"After owning multiple soundcore devices from ear buds, to speakers, their over-ear line and even parent company anker I’ve become accustomed to quality competitive priced products. The x600 is no different - the design is excellent and the plastic housing with metal handle feels well built. The sound, despite my expectations failed to live up to the HD audio certified tag and ultimately despite trying to fine tune I wound up returning the speaker. For its size, the bass is punchy when placed properly, the mids are a bit drowned and the highs get crunchy at time due in part to the spatial top speaker. Let me say that it is an interesting design and I hope they continue to pursue perfection on this because atmos/3D/360 audio is game changing as I listen on my 9.2.4 atmos theater system daily while working. This speaker however misses the mark, when the spatial is disabled the speaker gets muted severely. Missing highs and rumbling bass are all you get from it and for the price it doesn’t fulfill expectations. While the tiny speaker does impact the sound greatly - a good set of TWS speakers like the reasonably priced soundcore motion+ does a better job of sound stage isolation and frankly you can buy two of those for a price of one x600. Don’t get me wrong, this tech is cool and the speaker isn’t bad per say - it’s just not worth the current price tag of over a hundred seventy usd. It’s a hundred dollar speaker for sure, and you’d be best to spend money elsewhere or pick this up on sale. The associated EQ app is the best in the business and you can get this close to perfection up to medium level volume before the high sound kills the experience.","Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2024",AEU4QM6M252IYJLVIARY3YHJ3KHA,True,11,Color: Blue (Lunar Blue)

R30RILO0W9PEN0,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Very pleased with this purchase!,WMiracle,5,"Clean sound, good bass - IF you adjust it correctly. Get the Soundcore app and do a manual EQ. There are some maps out there on the web for the best set up (I can't remember where I found the one I am using, but I even tweaked that one a slight bit). This thing really is a good value. I enjoy listening to this. Also, I watched the UTube vids by Alan Ross. My experience is very different than his. I don't want a BOOMING, ghetto bass in my music. I want a good, growling, good depth of range that can get punchy when the source presents it as such. I totally get that from the x600. I hate muddy bass! and I don't get it from the x600. A couple of tuning points: 1. Where you place the x600 will effect the sound quality. It still sounds good in the middle of an open room, but sounds better closer to a wall. 2. Make sure to manually tweak the settings via the soundcore app. 3. I only play lossless audio (Flac) through my x600. MP3 can greatly vary in audio quality. I have a fine home audio system that I truly love, but I find myself pulling out the x600 and listening to it more and more. Is it as good as my home audio system? NO! But, it's really enjoyable listening to and I can take it from room to room or out in the garage. The sound is clean, wide, and has a satisfactory bass (more studio style, non-overamped). If you are looking for ghetto bass, you'll be disappointed. I'm tempted to get another x600 so that I can use in stereo sync mode. Also, this is a great TV sound bar if your TV has BT capabilities. Movies sound great through it!

Coming from Anker though there's no reason why this thing couldn't have been half battery and speaker so it last longer than 12 hours, I like to listen to this at night so I leave it plugged in now but I blew through the battery the first night. Would probably be just fine for taking it out with you and using, the type c charging is appreciated.

It comes with an app to control the settings however , the buttons on the top are very easy to use and control . It’s the perfect size for my end table next to my bed , for music or even for movies. I use it more often to watch movies since its connection is so good , it’ll pair to my tv without interference. The metal build of the speaker is nothing like I’ve used or seen before. The metal handle make it it easy to carry & transport. but I try my best not to have to movie it too much. it’s not the type of speaker I want to travel with , or use outdoors . The risk of dropping it and denting it if chipping the paint if the metal isn’t worth it. I prefer it on my shelf or end table.. I think it’s worth what I paid for it , it was 150$ at the time not 200$. Making it that much better if a deal for this Bluetooth speaker.update:.

R3057JFHDIMGUQ,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars A round of applause for this outstanding speaker,Wise Owl,5,"I have been a fan of Anker's Soundcore lineup for a while. I have the Flare 2, Motion Plus, Motion Boom, and Motion Boom Plus and while not the best sounding of the lineup it is my new favorite Anker has produced.First off the aesthetics. Except for the Flare 2 I'm used to speakers from them that frankly are rather ugly. Plastic and rubber with a metal mesh grill on the front. What a beauty this speaker is. I own a lot of bluetooth speakers and this is right up there with best. The look and feel of this speaker is just a pleasing all around.Of course if I bought speakers just for the looks I would likely not own what us arguabley one of the best affordable speaker brands out there. The Motion Plus has some of the best mids and highs, but lacks bass. The Motion Boom has the best bass of any speaker for its size, but is lacking on the highs. The Motion Boom Plus combines those two to deliver what I would consider the best sounding speaker of the lineup. The only speaker I think sounds better than the Boom Plus at its size would be the Tribit Stormbox Blast. Anything better than those cost twice the price and are a bit larger. Going a size down my favorite would be my JBL Charge 5.So where does this speaker fall? Well I would say it is a larger Motion Plus with bass that comes very close to the Motion Boom. It doesn't match up to the Boom Plus but it is also half the size. If we compare to my favorite speaker one size down the Charge 5 it destroys that speaker. I saw some reviews claiming this speaker lacked bass... No it definitely does not. It may not hit quite as hard as the M Boom, but that like I said has the best bass of absolutely all bluetooth speakers at its size and the gap here is very small. Suggesting it has less bass the the Motion Plus though could only be possible if their X600 is defective.Lastly the reason I'm a huge fan of Soundcore speakers is honestly because they have the best eq software out of any bluetooth speaker brand I have come across. You can truly tune your speaker to sound how you want it to with a tremendous amount of control. Most custom eqs have little change to the speaker. I mention this because except for maybe the Motion Boom Plus I have not had any speaker that sounds it's best with the standard Soundcore Signature tuning and this speaker is no exception. Out of the gate it is lacking a tiny bit in mid bass which might be what the other reviewers are complaing about with lack of bass as most speakers are mid bass forward. Even my Charge 5 had a little more mid bass out of the gate, but this trumped it on sub bass. You can even crank up the sub bass but too much and this speaker can't handle it and becomes a bit distorted at higher volumes.Overall this is hands down the best looking and nicest sounding speaker you will find at this price point. There is no smaller speaker that sounds better, so if you want better sound you will have to go larger. I highly recommend!","Reviewed in the United States May 14, 2023",AFLUZV54ZUQSQ3YSXRWXCSEU5JSA,True,76,Color: Black

I was adamant about avoiding a subpar sound bar or speaker and instead sought something portable that could deliver a powerful audio experience.Music is a vital part of my work routine, providing me with a unique source of inspiration and productivity. Being able to enjoy my favorite tunes at a reasonable volume while staying focused is a true pleasure.I am pleased to report that this speaker exceeded my expectations! Upon unboxing it, I was struck by its larger size compared to what I had anticipated. While smaller than an 80s lunchbox, it certainly had a more substantial presence than I was accustomed to. I connected it via Bluetooth to my laptop while keeping it plugged in (I prefer to have my electronics connected unless I specifically need them to be portable), and I was immediately impressed by the quality of the sound emanating from it as I streamed music from YouTube Music. The volume was so robust that I had to dial down my laptop's volume to 60%.The speaker's bass was just right—not overwhelming—and there was no distortion even when the volume was maxed out.Should I wish to switch to Bluetooth on my phone and bring the speaker outside while barbecuing or cleaning my truck, I can simply carry it outdoors and continue enjoying my favorite tunes.In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend this speaker—it is definitely worth the price.""Big"" Henry Approved!","Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2024",AEGHZHKDHSDLIT5OSLMQMHPAPJEA,True,10,Color: Black

R2E34W07W5X28C,B0BXW4KKXK,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great speakers, really needs battery capacity boost!",Jigar Patel,4,"Love the sound quality. Nothing beats this at the $50 discount.CONS:1. Battery life/capacity NEEDS a massive upgrade. Currently it works for 10-11 hours on 50-60% volume with BASS + Sound Boost enabled.2. Slightly on the heavier side so not as easy to carry around3. SBS performs much better indoors due to sound bouncing off the walls (tested in a 200 sq. ft. room).4. 50% volume fills the room quite well with SBS5. Hate the rubber flap (not in pictures) at the back, covering USB C/AUX port. It's added for water proofing but over the years that rubber will get brittle and break off. I would have preferred SoundCore using independent plugs for each port which could be user replaceable.6. Bottom rubber feet could be much larger for better grip, it's sufficient for now, but even a slight incline 10-20 degrees, and I feel the speaker will fall flat due to rumbling from BASS at higher volumesPROS:1. Great build quality.2. Premium quality materials used3. Got it at a 50$ discount which placed this product as a must buy, the pricing was perfect during black friday sale.4. SBS is a great feature that no other speaker provides at this cost. It seems gimmicky, not truly 3D audio, but it does a great job in filling the room5. BASS on this is ridiculously outstanding. I'm not a huge fan of thumping audio, but I can say that this is quite good.6. Audio doesn't crackle even at 80-90% volume levels, but it will be tested with times. I doubt I'll even use it above 30-40% levels.7. 50W speakers, apparently louder than most budget televisions that come with 30-40W speakers inbuilt.Overall, if it's at a $50+ discount, go with this blindly if battery capacity is not an issues.For me, this is my main speaker for my laptop and is used 12+ hours a day so have to charge daily which is cumbersome. I do not want to keep it perpetually plugged in, may degrade battery.","Reviewed in the United States December 16, 2023",AHNHUATGMGO3NI5EZTXB3ZUKLJAA,True,20,Color: Black

Sound quality is beautiful and setup wasn’t too difficult. You do need the app to fine tune the sound and that is necessary depending on the room, the music, and your personal preferences. However there are a few things to consider:1. If using in the bedroom you will need to get LED covers for the top buttons as they are very bright. But it does make a good night light if you need it. It will automatically shut off after a period of time it does not receive a signal. You can set that time via the app.2. The app has 4 brightness adjustment for the buttons! Nice!3. The usb C charging cable is ridiculously short, so save yourself the headache of trying to find a way to charge the device 6-inches from an outlet and purchase a longer cable.4. No charger included and no clear guidance in the instructions on ones that will work. I had an old iPhone 5V/3A USB C charger and checked with Soundcore customer service (which is great) and they confirmed it was safe to use for charging. Used it on a six hour charge via an outlet (not a power strip) and it worked just fine.5. Definitely play with the EQ settings in the app - you can adjust the bass if the surface the speaker is on resonates too much, or just tailor the sound to your ears.6. A 6-hour charge for only 12-hours playing time is a kinda poor, but the sound quality outweighs that issue for me since mine will always be near an outlet.7. Speaking of which, the Soundcore FAQs recommend the speaker NOT be used while charging. This is not in the QTG or additional instructions.8. I understand there are differences in the available spatial sound options in the Android app vs the Apple app. Check to see what the differences are for your device.Are these enough to return it? Heck no! The sound quality is great. The build quality is solid. It totally meets my needs and I have enjoyed listening to all genres of music.

However, the Motion X600 performs so much better than the patio speakers that we have taken to using it instead in nearly every instance. The bass is surprising from a speaker of this size, the clarity is crisp without being harsh, and the spatial audio effect is just about mind-blowing.

After my own research, I ended up with the Soundcore Motion X600 Bluetooth & AUX Input (sweet) with the main selling feature is the Spatial Audio. Wow the sound of Soundcore really delivers an amazing sound especially the BASS when playing Techno music sounds. The volume from my IPad is set to 75% and my daughter can still listen it from the second floor . Bluetooth pairing is easy peasy with both Apple products (IPhone & IPad) and PC Windows 10.What I don't like with the SoundCore Motion is the short battery life when using the BASS , short USB-C cable charger, and no indicator when battery is low ONLY a red light blinking on the power button.

R1V430Z8TGBDGN,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Speaker – Would give 10 stars if it were possible!!!,Orion_EJ,5,"For context I have had the Bose Soundlink II, a superb speaker, for about 10 years but my teenage son recently commandeered it so this is a replacement. There wasn’t a new version of the Soundlink II on the market just other Bose products (e.g., Soundlink mini II and revolve) that did not fit the bill so I decided to see if there was anything else on the market. I listened to the Sony XGR 300, Sonos Era 100 and B & O Beosound explore. Short story the Sony was very good all round (nice bass kick and volume), but did not have the clarity and sound quality of the X600. Also, the Sony design was not as sophisticated as the 600X. The Sonos ERA 100 was very neutral (bass was not deep enough and treble not high enough). Also, the design was somewhat generic and it lacked the stereo separation of either the Sony or the 600X. The B&O while in a similar price range did not play as loud and got distorted very quickly when you raised the volume which was surprising for a B&O product. Also, bass sounded very puny…probably best for small applications like replacing a set of headphones as it was completely out of its depth in this comparison. The 600x was clearer, had a huge soundstage and by far the deepest and cleanest bass punch. It is actually a big improvement from the excellent Bose Soundlink II. The construction feels solid, the design is sleek, and it sounds absolutely fantastic much like a bigger stereo speaker. I have played Jazz, Electronica, R&B, trap beats, Afrobeat, and other genres through the 600X and everything sounds insane! Just listened to Trappist Nights - Geotheory, Donald Byrd – Flight time, and Maxwell – reunion and I am hearing things I haven’t heard before.. very impressive! Two tips:1) Download the Soundcore app and use the custom EQ setting to tweak your music as desired. I read through some of the low rated reviews including a user who said the EQs made no difference and it really makes you wonder. There is a very clear difference as you move through the different EQ presets not to mention using the custom setting to tailor your sound (see pictures)2) Leave the Mega bass and spatial sound buttons on (see picture) and be wowed! Your ears and eyes will need some recalibration before you believe that what you are hearing is coming from a speaker of that size!","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2023",AGZ7F7J3NF34YHRWN753LCZRYVPA,True,71,Color: Black

It provides a level of detail beyond what I'd expect from a smaller portable speaker, it has a fairly open sound stage from the combination of real stereo separation (a must for me) and the spatial speaker, and it creates surprisingly accurate bass - even at very low volume (another must for me). Deeper sub-bass rolls off, but that's to be expected given the speaker's compact size. Other reviewers have mentioned this, but the heft and build quality of the speaker is really good. Overall, I'm very impressed and happy to add the X600 as a new option to listen to music - bravo.Okay - a brief update on my review. My wife and I recently went out for dinner and had a couple of margaritas. We came back home and she wanted to listen to some music vs. watch TV, so I thought to pull the X600 out and play it. We did some “digging in the crates” on Qobuz playing some old school music in the family room and I cranked this box up more than I had before. I was really amazed - the sound opened up a lot, it was clear, loud and actually did bounce around the family room - it was plent loud for us at 50% volume. Lastly, I couldn’t believe the bass extension I was getting from a speaker this size. I have to say Bravo again!","Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2023",AERFWTLZBSZSD764CW6G5GP6PPJA,True,75,Color: Black

The stock sound is bad, no way around it. Weak bass, lacking clarity in the highs, just a total miss in what seemed to be a new flagship in their bluetooth line.Post EQ? It slaps. Toy with it, don't just use the stock settings, find a signature for your own tastes and you will be rewarded. I'm getting some good deep bass out of the unit now. It's not crazy fast or clean but I'll never expect that from a speaker like this. For what it is, at the price it's at, it delivers the goods. I listen to extreme metal genres so a bad speaker will just fall apart under the stress of trying to keep up with the madness. I'm really impressed with how well this is doing.Spatial audio sounds good on some tracks and bad on others so it isn't a blanket victory in that department, it distorts the sound a bit, so sloppy mixes do come out sounding very rough, but polished tracks sound absolutely fantastic with the spatial turned on, so the wins are just as big as the losses in that area.The build quality is a clear highlight. The metal construction makes it feel like you have something of quality in your hands, the weight removes any sense that you're handling a cheap unit.4/5 simply because this isn't a high price unit and it can't produce a high price sound. It kills in its price bracket, but always understand that you're getting a middle tier bluetooth speaker and it's going to sound like one.","Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2023",AHBQRPRPLGGTWGNWVRX3JQATJHQA,True,13,Color: Black

How can a “portable” speaker be getting so many rave reviews? Being a huge fan of Anker products in general (Soundcore is a division of Anker) I know they make quality products so when Black Friday rolled around and saw this speaker on sale, I decided to bite the bullet. Did I need another speaker? Like I need a bullet in my head. But boy am I glad that I took the plunge!Out of the box, it was extremely easy to set up. It pairs in seconds with any Bluetooth device (in this case my phone) and within minutes I was jamming away. Make sure you download the Soundcore app so you can get the latest software updates and the ability to mess with the equilizers.Also the Spatial Audio feature is amazing and pairs perfectly with Apple Music. It sounds so great that I just leave the function on all the time.The speaker is a bit heavy to really be bringing it around every where you go, but I also don’t think it’s really meant to be moved around constantly.

I keep the spatial and bass on and the default setting is pretty nice to me. But preference is subjective for sure. The spatial feature definitely adds a kick to the audio, a more immersive feel. When you turn it off it sounds flat but when it’s on it’s a diff experience. So I’m keeping that feature on. Build quality is 👌 feels premium and seems I paid $400 for it but I didn’t.

Plus I never received an answer as to what type I should use. Also no answer from a previous message on messenger. Poor CS I think.Great they have an 18 month warranty (if you can track down CS).The thing sounds great on certain audio. Problem is spatial audio can begin to sound screechy on certain tracks. I listen to a lot of older stuff. If it’s not somehow made to be more modern (think analog vs digital) the thing is more of a nuisance to listen to than a pleasure. Even my AirPods Pro 2 have this issue. It’s a nice thing when it sounds good, but it can drive you batty switching back and forth.Soundcore has cornered the market on the pleasantly made Audio Units that fit a certain budget. They fall well short of upper end stuff, but then again, you get what you pay for.In my particular case I notice the bass is not as clean sounding as something by Bose or Sonos to name a couple.The app has ok sound presets, but it can be a bit clunky to work with. Good thing they include custom EQ as their available four or so are not the best. Better sound is achieved by tweaking the sound. Far better.As I wrote in my title, soundcore is a second level audio producer in my opinion. Think soundesign for those that remember the brand. Needs a boost to be just a bit better, seems adequate at the price point. Unfortunately if you’ve owned any premium stuff, it leaves you empty. No matter how pretty.I have a motion + that I bought a few years back. Sounds as good minus the troublesome spatial audio for half the price. I’d recommend that unit as it has just as good basic sound and most the features it’s prettier sister here has. Plus it seems a bit more durable, but not as pretty with its rubber covering, ipx 7 rating and 12 hr battery time. If you don’t need gimmicky spatial audio in a slightly smaller package, that’s the ticket.If you are a true lover of audio devices that have a real authentic sound to the ear, this device is going to leave you feeling like you aren’t quite sure if you like it. My opinion of course.Good thing Amazon has a liberal return policy as mine is being returned.Wait for something better. I’m sure eventually someone in the higher end game will eventually produce a spatial audio piece. Unless they already have. Portability is a bonus for this unit versus something like the echo studio.I wanted to like it, but it just doesn’t quite have that quality of sound the price commands. I’d consider it at under $150, even then I’m not sure it’s money well spent.","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2023",AHMG7ZKS2QGZ7X6JDZDRQ7WYR5XQ,True,15,Color: Green(Aurora Green)

It prepared me for what was to follow.As instructed, I charged it thoroughly before using it, then downloaded the app and started listening. At first, I liked the overall sound; it was bright and had a nice mid-range tone. The bass is good, even excellent, but a bit finicky. The bass is solid and firm if appropriately placed with a wall behind it. Stand-alone, it could be more powerful, but this should be expected with a product this size and price.The app needs more work, the tone controls vary, and minor adjustments don't make much difference, yet they can be detected. I want more range for the equalizer.I also have a Marshall Stanmore, which is a more expensive Speaker. It doesn't have a battery. Compared to the X600, it sounds bland. I am thinking of selling my Stanmore and getting a second X600 for stereo.The problem is that this speaker is in a crowded price category; it should be less expensive. I received an offer to get $50 off, I paid $150, and it's a good value for that price. If I had purchased it for the full $200 price, I would have sent it back.I have found that the microphone is excellent, we use this for group meetings and it picks up sound extremely well, as well as the Bose unit it replaced.Overall, a good speaker with a great battery life, needs a lower price to really stand out in this market.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2023",AHITCP5I5P35JH6CCMQY3JH7XR2A,True,12,Color: Black

(I got the blue one)So the sound is good with tweaking needed all the time. The speaker is undergoing updates all the time, and each time the sound changes significantly. I’m having issues with the passive radiator distorting or moving in and out at the wrong time proportioned to the woofers, so with bass up on it doesn’t sound good. Spatial mode is basically required, without it, it’s a performance cut, or dull mode. I found that when using custom eq is when my bass distorts. I’m having better luck with good sound with the preset options. It’s crystal clear and pretty bright, and sometimes tiresome. Just find what eq or preset works for you. When using custom eq bass up needs to be off, for me at least. Even though the app says bass up isn’t available when using custom, it clearly has bass up capability’s in custom eq.Overall good good speaker that needs tweaking and updates. Hopefully they will have an update that fixes the passive radiator issue.Alan Ross reviews is a great place to get to know the speaker, and other speakers.

Out of the box it sounds better than most anything in its price range, but once the eq is adjusted for your liking.. it’s a great device.

This thing has some heft and feels solid. You won't be strapping this thing to your belt though! It will also add a significant amount of weight to a backpack. The bass response is very good, but just as importantly, the treble response is also pretty good. Many of the other bluetooth speakers on the market also have decent bass response but are lacking good high frequency response, which for me is just as important. The ""immersive spatial sound"" is impressive. You can definitely hear the difference between having it on and turning it off.All that being said, in my opinion it is lacking a few important features. There is no battery charge level indication on the speaker itself. You have to have a smart phone and the Soundcore app in order to see the battery charge level. This brings us to the second thing that's missing, a way to plug in an SD card or USB doggle in order to play anything on this speaker. Lastly, it would have been nice if the handle could fold down to lower the speaker's profile and give easier access to the top controls.All in all I like this thing. It has more than enough bass for the type of music I like: Jazz, R&B, Classic Rock, Folk, Classical, Acoustic Guitar. For some music I turn the bass boost off because it's a little too exaggerated. Either that or I use a custom equalizer setting. The highs are nice and defined and the sound of fingers sliding across the strings with guitar music is crisp.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2023",AG73X2YTIQ5QLKV46OLWIR5QM4ZQ,True,6,Color: Green(Aurora Green)

I really cannot believe how incredible this thing is I mean the spatial sound, and the tight base the imaging somehow they duplicated all of the good audiophile characteristics, and jammed them into this little box, a little bit bigger than a transistor radio now it is not true audiophile sound there’s all kinds of little things done that make it seem that way. That being said, this is a phenomenal sounding box.","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2024",AEKOFSLAC3LOBHN2YSUFGKVFDDVA,True,3,Color: Green(Aurora Green)
RV2TIEYXFBZQ9,B0BXW4KKXK,4.0 out of 5 stars Overhyped!!! Useful for outdoor.,OnlyHonest,4,"Update(Feb 2024):This speaker is all hyped and so many youtubers making video of this speaker.At first, I have it a 5 stars, but now I give it a 4 because Harman Kardon speakers are on sale that are the same price as this or cheaper.I got myself HK go + Play 3 for $150 and the sound makes the x600 sound like crap. However, the x600 is smaller and you can use type c charger which is more convenient for outdoors.Am I comparing an outdoor speaker vs indoor??? I dunno hehe.I did notice that the x600 is louder because you can make it louder by messing with the EQ or settings. It sounds like crap though if super loud.All in all, I recommend the HK products if on sale for mostly indoors due to poor battery lifeAnd the x600 speaker for outdoor if using it for infinite hours because you can bring your own charger to charge this speaker using type c which is so convenient.","Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2023",AE6UGJAXXCALVWKBHIUJDTDHLXXQ,True,2,Color: Blue (Lunar Blue)
R3A61BAHWAU2II,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Sounds great,Craig Frazier,5,This is the best bluetooth speaker of this size I have ever heard. It has decent low end but the high end sounds amazing. You can hear the difference of different cymbals in the drum kit. I am very happy with this speaker.,"Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2024",AGOYWWOV5ICD35OAPQRN3XOSNESA,True,2,Color: Black
R17J8G3Q7UN6DU,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound!!!,lopez07si,5,"Not sure why all the negative reviews because this speaker has incredible sound. Yes the bass go down as you raise the volume but it's still there and it's clean and tight. Not muddy like JBL speakers. I bought 2 of these (green and blue to match my living room decor) and they sound loud, clear and amazing. I listen mostly to Latin music (salsa, bachata, reggaeton) and this speaker brings out the best in each genre. I can hear every instrument, the vocals and just enough bass to highly enjoy any song. Can't wait for soundcore to start making TV soundbars.","Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AH3WVIT5LRBFXDRZT6XFYBA4K74Q,True,2,Color: Blue (Lunar Blue)
R3TI7U70YNPLLH,B0BXW4KKXK,4.0 out of 5 stars Really wanted to like this speaker.,Darryl C.,4,"To start off with the good. Great build quality. Feels and looks very premium. Comes in 3 different colors. Pretty loud for its size. Like that Soundcore is pushing the envelope. The bad. Sound at different volume levels is very inconsistent.The bass response is very low quality unless you're listening at no more than 25 percent volume. The spatial sound can get pretty tiring due to its upper range. With this speaker you are constantly tweaking the eq and the voices don't sound natural. Really disappointed because I own the Motion+ and I really like how natural it sounds. I play the X600 usually with spatial off but had to create a eq to tame the highs when using it. Deeper, better controlled bass would make this a much better speaker. Looking for the next firmware update. Hopefully coming soon. Will update.Update: After 2 firmware updates: This speaker sounds much better now. More natural voices and the highs, mids to mid bass sounds more cohesive. Just a cleaner fuller sound without sounding overly bright. Bass response is better but you can easily overdrive the drivers. Any other problems can be fixed in the custom eq. The expanded eq is even better but you need to know what you're doing. Soundcore has done a good job with the updates and customers looking for a clean crisp sound profile with decent bass will be pleased. A very detailed speaker, Bass heads look elsewhere. I increased my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2023",AHNAHJICZOLAX6LP3DZ3NF6IHP6A,True,2,Color: Black

R14MA7BFWCZCMQ,B0BXW4KKXK,3.0 out of 5 stars Decent but I wouldn't call it hi res,bmak,3,"I just bought one of these during the Prime sale for $150. Build quality is good, it's solid. Battery life is ok at around 10-12 hours but there are better out there. Calling this hi resolution audio is pushing it. The spatial sound feature is interesting but nothing to right home about. I can see using this for a workshop, outdoor party, beach etc but not as primary audio. I played this next to my Sony SRS-XB43 ($125 on sale) and my home audio system on Led Zep 1 and Cream Wheels of Fire. The Soundcore does sound a little better than the Sony but not by much. The Sony has much more of a bass sound where the Soundcore is more crisp. They seem equally loud with the Soundcore maybe a little less distorted at high volume. The Sony has about twice the battery life. Both are waterproof so can be used at a beach or on a boat. Would I use the Soundcore for my primary home audio? No, I'd get listening fatigue. Take the $200 and invest in a decent used receiver and speakers and buy a bluetooth receiver to plug in. If you want real hi res for home use stream Tidal directly to a home receiver or play vinyl / CDs. No comparison. Would I buy it again? Maybe. If it was still $150 and if I didn't already have a good quality bluetooth speaker I would. It would be great for a college dorm for your favorite student. It does sound good for what it is. Would I buy it for $200 as an upgrade to my Sony or a similar high quality bluetooth speaker that I already own? Probably not. I am on the fence as to whether I'll return it or gift it to my daughter. If I could have demo'd it in a store first I most likely would have taken a pass.","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2023",AGSJHHZRWHERU57OTUXTWHY4C3KQ,True,3,Color: Black
R100MM0WJ2PBG8,B0BXW4KKXK,4.0 out of 5 stars Sounds good! BUT…,Patricia Khan,4,"I’m so disappointed that this uses a C-type charge cable from both ends. No basic USB cable to charge it and all my battery packs use USB ports. So now I need to find a way to charge portably, because I doubt this battery actually lasts 12 hrs. I will know for sure by tomorrow, when I test it out at the beach. But the sound is definitely great. Will update my review in a few days.UPDATE: 8/14/23I took the radio to the beach. It sounds great! I didn’t alter any of the features on the APP. I read I could make the speaker sound better by messing with the APP controls but that it would compromise battery life. Straight out of the box, fully charged and at maximum volume, the battery lasted 6.5 hours. Not even close to the 12 hrs stated. Still deciding if I want to keep it or return it.","Reviewed in the United States August 12, 2023",AHJMR4SHJYM6EBFJREKGJKH4ZEWA,True,3,Color: Black
RW1O73ON2Z29L,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars It is a little pricey but the quality is fantastic.,Alex Foord,5,"I am a big supporter of Soundcore and Anker. When I received an email that they were launching this product, after having already purchased the Soundcore 3 water proof speaker for my shower, I knew I’d have to get it.I brought it to my father’s 70th surprise party and used this as the speaker for the background music at the restaurant. It’s portable, light weight and easy to carry. However, it sounds like a much larger speaker and the bass is great. High quality and very pleased.Also, the battery life is ridiculous, in a good sense. I charge it once a month and use it every day for 15-20 minutes.","Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2023",AGVZWWNO6AYAA5U6ZPE3OAFXF6AA,True,4,Color: Black
