While I wish it came with some type of case as the container it comes in is just solely for that, there aren't many cons to this device. It is small and it packs a heavy sound. Overall, the quality is great.The battery life also deserves some mentioning as it can lasts a long time without charge. I'd say at least 8+ hours. Buy it.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AF6G66WPN4NP7OERBY6MAY6X7NEQ,True,6,Style: Flip 5Color: Black
R2IK77E0Q7YTWP,B07QK2SPP7,5.0 out of 5 stars Might be small but awesome speaker!!!,donna jenkins,5,"My husband bought one of these JBL flip 5 Bluetooth speakers when he was out of town working so his work crew could listen to music while working. Well when he came home I borrowed his to take to work, I am a nurse at a small nursing home and my residents love to listen to music they will come out of their rooms and sit at their doorways so they can hear my music from my flip 5 speaker that I sit on top of my med cart in the hallway and all my residents can hear such great quality music from such a little device. I will even dance in the hallway with them even if they are in wheelchairs or can stand. It is amazing what some good peppy music does for even the elderly people, I can see their whole attitudes change and the smiles on their faces are priceless. One resident that recently passed away from COVID, was sitting in her doorway months ago as I had my flip 5 on and music playing and I asked her who was her favorite musician or song and I like to fell out when this elderly Caucasian female said Michael Jackson and song was Billie Jean so I looked it up on my phone and played it for her and she was in a wheelchair but she still patted her foot to the music and tapped her hand and fingers on her table and at times I could hear her singing along and this made me so happy to do this for her we had a great time that Sunday afternoon and a memory I will never forget This awesome little cute speaker charges up quickly just a few hours and good to go and I have used mine for a whole 8 plus shift even if not playing music it would still be on and I have yet to hear any low battery beeps etc. My husband loves that they are waterproof because of him working outside in the dirt and rain. He said what sold him on buying one for him was a friend he worked with had one also and forgot his hanging on the basket on a line truck and the next morning he got it and had dirt and mud on it so he took it over to the water hose and washed it off and all the dirt and mud can completely off and the water didn't do anything to this flip 5 speaker he shook it as dry as he could get it then hung it back on his bucket on his line truck and turned it on and worked just as good as before. I say if u love music and love even sharing music with others this little speaker is highly recommended by me and my husband. It is simple to connect to his and my iPhones. The buttons on the speakers are very easy to press and can be easily seen on the speaker. Also the volume can be adjusted by my iPhone volume buttons too. It makes the cutest sound when connecting to my phone which tells me is is connected. Never had an issue with it disconnecting for no reason. The range is good that is the range that my cell phone is from the speaker never had an issue with that I play music on it and put my cell in my scrub pocket and I am up and down the hallways and in rooms with doors closed and music keeps playing. I can't think of one problem/issue or complaint about this JBL flip 5 speaker. Worth the money and my residents appreciate me spending this small amount of money for them to have some happiness in their day and I do too. My husband bought his from a person advertising a used one wanting to sell when he was up north working I think he bought his for $50 dollars but I always use my Amazon prime so in case I don't like something I buy or have an issue I can return free and free 2 day shipping. And not very much more did I pay here for mine. I got pink and it is a pale pink not bright pink. I like it. I don't know if my managers at the nursing home that I work at would care or not about me playing music over my speaker but even if they did I would probably still sneak and do it because of the reactions I get from my elderly confused residents the smiles on their faces is why I would go against what a manager tells me not to do and do it anyway. These residents don't get much joy to be honest esp since COVID and isolation since middle of March 2020. They are depressed because they can not see (except through a closed window in their rooms) and can not touch their loved ones we that work there and love everyone of our residents don't replace the touch and hugs ans kisses they would be getting from the people they love the most in this world their children and grandchildren and even great grandchildren we have had residents pass away and they and their families haven't seen or touched since COVID and these are precious memories they can never get back it is depressing to me and I play music to keep all our minds off this depressing situation we are in right now and this little speaker helps me do this and is powerful enough to be heard from my med cart all the way down hallways and inside rooms. So even the residents that are bedridden can still hear some good music. So if u like good quality sound that can come from a small well built Bluetooth speaker that won't break your wallet then please buy this one. It also has a rope handle that my husband uses to hang his off the side of his bucket and it be out of his way. He is a lineman and stands in a bucket with limited room up high off the ground sometimes all day long so the rope handle is strong enough to hang this Light weight speaker from a hook and no worries of it breaking. Also I have accidentally dropped my speaker out of my nursing bad onto the cement floor in the nursing home and scared me because I would have been sick if it had broke my awesome speaker but turned it on and worked as usual I dropped it outside in the parking lot and no issues. Hope my review helps you realize this speaker is a good buy and u will be happy u did buy this one.

RFFRITGSRAF1H,B07QK2SPP7,5.0 out of 5 stars Very happy with this little speaker!,agendreau65,5,"I've been debating on getting a portable Bluetooth speaker for quite a while and decided to finally pull the trigger. Got this today and am very impressed with the sound quality for the price. I'm pretty well versed in the audio world (used to sell home theater, headphones, Bluetooth speakers and car audio for 6 years) but this thing's the bomb digitty! It's slightly larger than a 16 oz can, doesn't weigh a lot but feels dense and solid and high quality. I'll be using this a lot. BBQ's, podcasts/music in the shower or doing stuff around the apartment. Fits in a cup holder for a lawn chair or car (if you have an old car with no bluetooth or your speakers are bad, etc..) it sounds pretty dang good for its size. I'd highly recommend if you're looking for something good for under $100.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AHHJ4MUK2MK4NM43LI2VSUFTHI6Q,True,8,Style: Flip 5Color: Black

R2A8PC4075BC2E,B07QK2SPP7,5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful Sound...,Symone191,5,"Let me begin by saying that I am not a bells and whistles type person. my focus is the quality I receive from a product I purchase. When I purchase a car, I could care less if the seats heat up or if it's slick and flashy. Those things are nice, but my goal is to not have to constantly take my vehicle for repairs after I've finished making the payments. So, I don't care that this speaker doesn't light-up or have bells and whistles. What I like about this speaker is that the sound is awesome. I was pleasantly surprised that a speaker this small could pack such a big punch. I think you will be pleasantly surprised with the sound and the quality. I opted to pay a couple of dollars more and purchase the black, since it will be used outdoors. Try it.

But the sound quality of these less expensive speakers never sounded that good. Not bad but not as good as I would have liked. So I thought I’m going to spend a little more money and buy myself a name brand quality Bluetooth speaker. I researched Bose and JBL speakers and settled on this one. I couldn’t be more happy with the sounds coming out of this speaker. Bass you can feel in your chest. Mid-tones and treble perfectly matched to the bass. Do not hesitate to buy this speaker.

Sound quality is exactly what's to be expected from JBL and frankly, I was pleasantly surprised with it. Hit the bass boost in a large room and away you go! Now I read with interest the poor reviews primarily centered around battery life or lack thereof. I believe the issue(s) with the battery is consumer induced. I charge the unit before using it (the manual suggest not operating it while plugged in) and directly afterwards before storage. After eight weeks of usage, not so much as a hiccup. Now I imagine running the battery low or until the unit shuts down (also not recommended in the owner's manual) and storing in a discharged state is counter intuitive, unless the the operator has an IQ equal to that of a root vegetable. I highly recommend this product... it performs wonderfully and I imagine, as a JBL product, will so for some time to come. Great value for the dollar.
