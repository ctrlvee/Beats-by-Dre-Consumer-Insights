RCGV5NMTHKPPC,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Value Soundbar,Lance Hough,5,"I've now had this sound bar for just under four years. It is still performing wonderfully, still sounds great, and still works just as well as the day I took it out of the box. The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price you pay. Is it perfect? No? Will it hold up to a unit that's 4x the price? Not even kinda. But is it better than the speakers on your standard consumer-grade flat-screen TV? You better believe it. Better by a mile. It has several different sound modes depending on what you're watching, easily connects to your Bluetooth devices to play music, and offers very simple connection to your TV. The remote is crap, but you likely won't need it anyway. Most TVs now come with programmable remotes that you can use to control the basic functions of the soundbar. I use the Yamaha Soundbar app to control the more detailed features as it's easier and more clear visually. It gets plenty loud and does not distort or crack in higher volumes. I have noticed that when watching OTA broadcast TV (read: not through a cable box or streaming device), TV shows that feature live music performances are particularly challenging for this soundbar. The vocals during songs are always totally buried. However, watching music videos, streaming music, or watching concert videos seems to be fine. It's a strange issue, but there's no doubt it exists. And I've tried multiple modes with no success. But it's a minor issue comparatively. I'm very happy with this unit and will continue to use it until one of us stops working.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2024",AG2LX62LCZ3EQYIZNIAV2D3O7H2A,True,1,Style: YAS-109BL
RRQ3MWB3BY1AJ,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Easy setup,Bruce Turner,5,"Nice sounding soundbar with subwoofer. Easy set up with arc cable. You should have a new style hdmi cable that has the arc wires updated. Old hdmi doesn’t work too well/ old cables cut on / off / weird stuff.. The sound is ok for a small to average room, not too powerful for a large area. A easy & great way to update your tv speakers..you should un enable the auto off for 8 hours. It’s easy. Arc cable allows the tv to control the on/off/ sound level. Only one control.love that the subwoofer is wireless and auto connects.

R50V9T04DPPMV,B07T5GGR8L,4.0 out of 5 stars Tough to beat for the price!,Joe,4,"I am working on transforming part of my basement into a semi-finished space for a small exercise room. Sound off of a TV's built in speakers isn't going to cut it, so I needed a better solution.I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile, but I do appreciate good sound. I have a bunch of conventional receiver/speaker setups throughout the house - several 2.0 systems and a 5.1 in the living room.In this basement application, I wanted something simpler and cheaper. I compared this Yamaha setup to a similar Polk and Klipsch sound bar/sub combination. I have had positive experiences with all three brands, but ended up choosing the Yamaha mainly due to the killer price.The subwoofer was a little bigger than I expected for a 6.5"" unit, but not big enough to be an issue in my intended location. One oddity with the bar itself - the mounting holes aren't 16"" on center even though they easily could have been. I mounted it to a cedar plank wall and fortunately I still had the back side open and was able to add a couple 2x4s between studs to provide a more solid mounting point. On sheetrock, I think you'd be okay with good sized anchors since it isn't terribly heavy but it would still be better if Yamaha had gone with a standard 16"" spacing to allow for hitting studs.The unit powered up right away and was relatively easy to add to my wireless network. It is 2.4 GHz only, like many smart home devices but this is okay for me. 2.4 GHz could have interference issues in a dense apartment building, however. The app is okay - it seems they should have fit more controls on one page, but I don't anticipate using it much.I immediately queued up some songs on Spotify to try it out. It played over the network without an issue. Rating the sound quality depends on what you're comparing it to. If I compare it to the RCF Monitors in my garage or my Yamaha driven Polk 5.1 setup in the living room it's not even close, but I wasn't expecting it to be given the huge difference in price. Compare it to a solid set of 2.1 computer speakers at a similar price point, though, and it'll absolutely blow them away. I unfortunately can't compare to other sound bars since I have limited experience with them.For this application, it's plenty. Music does sound good - the bass is solid for a 6.5"" subwoofer, and the mids/highs are better than expected for such a compact unit. I've been using it while I continue remodeling the basement and I'm happy with the sound quality. I leave it set on stereo as other modes seem somewhat artificial to me.I did run into an issue with Bluetooth - I could not get it to appear as an option no matter how hard I tried. I performed a factory reset and that fixed the issue. Otherwise, it's been working very reliably.Bottom line: If you're looking for a secondary system in a basement or bedroom, this should suit your needs very well. For a small to medium sized living room, it would be acceptable and a whole lot better than TV speakers if you aren't willing to invest in a 5.1 or 7.1 system. For the price, it's tough to go wrong.","Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2023",AHVSNGUVQK35ZGUQB5IBMC4H6XDQ,True,28,Style: ATS-2090BL-R
R3KSST9OWGJLEJ,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Built-in speakers on today's TV are horrible. This Yamaha soundbar is so much better.,Tyson B.,5,"I received this ATS-2090 soundbar from Yamaha in renewed condition. It arrived professionally repackaged, in custom formed protective styrofoam and each major component in a sealed plastic bag. The only piece which showed any evidence of prior use was one of the two power cords. The twist tie used to secure it was slightly distorted. No parts or documentation were missing.The firmware on the unit was out of date, but the sound bar automatically updated itself as soon as it was connected to my home WiFi network. I might comment that it (the soundbar) only supports 2.4GHz wireless networks. There is no 5GHz WiFi support. I had no problems installing the app on my iPhone, and I find the app easy to navigate and extremely useful.The sound quality is so much better than the built-in speakers on my bargain 40"" flat panel TV. I knew the built-in speakers were bad, but after enjoying this sound bar it would be impossible to go back. I did adjust the bass level to +0 (it is set to +3 as a default) and I turned off the ""bass extension"" option using the app. With these adjustments, the bass from the wireless subwoofer integrates reasonably well and really accentuates most any TV program or movie soundtrack. I do have the wireless subwoofer located a few inches away from the wall, near a corner of the room, and just behind the TV itself.The actual connectivity took a little bit of experimentation. This is not a problem with the soundbar itself, but rather a consequence of the technology. My TV does not have an ARC capable HDMI connection. I am currently using the HDMI pass-through feature of the sound bar, and I have not connected the optical cable. My TV input comes only from an Android TV device, which streams content from a DLNA server, as well as Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, etc. The pass-through works perfectly for this application. It will still require a small learning curve for my family to become accustomed to turning the soundbar on prior to use, or perhaps I will need to defeat the auto power off feature (as described in the manual).I did experiment with the CEC settings on my TV to prevent devices from turning on or off unexpectedly, and I think I also needed to set the HDMI audio output setting on my Android device to PCM, Dolby Digital, or DTS. This is all noted in the Yamaha documentation. Again, further trial & error with CEC settings may be helpful, as it would be nice if the sound bar faithfully turned on & off with the TV.I would definitely purchase this sound bar again, especially at the renewed price. I'm considering buying a second for the TV set in the rec room... can I run two of the wireless subs in the same household without problems? Highly recommended.(10/18 - edited for grammar and writing style)11/20 - Owned for over a month now. I’m still extremely pleased. There’s been no weird situations where “it just stopped working” or anything like that. Totally would buy again.","Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2021",AEC4TPE7JLS2HPABNPL7TG7F2CGA,True,41,Style: ATS-2090BL-R
R2K34ZPFT3QAWQ,B07T5GGR8L,1.0 out of 5 stars Not recommended! Stopped playing audio 3 months after I bought it,mikeg77,1,"Edit: I previously replaced one of these for it stopping working within a few days; this one crapped out on me in 3 months. I was originally passing HDMI signal through it with my AppleTV providing content. It no longer passes through video, and using ARC it no longer plays audio through the speakers. This item responds to the remote control, but it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to: play audio. Recommend “Do Not Buy”I’ve had this sound bar for about a week now, and something I’ve noticed is that the sound can drop out for a half second on streaming video. I have an AppleTV passing through it to a Sony Bravia LED. When the sound drops out for a little longer, the screen shows that the TV is switching to internal speakers. I don’t think this is a cable issue, but I’ll try replacing them.The device is described as providing a voluminous experience, but so far that’s not the case. It doesn’t use a calibration microphone like most Yamaha surround receivers would so it doesn’t do any sort of beam forming to provide surround sound. The built in sub capability is anemic. The sound bar has a sub out, so I have it hooked up to a 12” Klipsch sub and that helps out quite a bit.It only has one 1 HDMI input, so my PS4 may have to get run through a switch, or I’ll connect the PS4 and AppleTV directly to the TV and use the ARC to the sub.I don’t have much use for the built-in Alexa capability as I have a bunch of Echo’s around the apartment, so I can’t really review that.The system is extremely simple though, which is something I like over my previous configuration of running speaker wires; in my new apartment I don’t have a spot to put the rear surrounds anyway. The remote is very straight forward and only has 17 buttons plus 2 directional buttons (subwoofer and volume).The sound quality is overall pretty good, and it can get pretty loud. The 3D Surround function seems to increase the number of channels accessed and output through the speakers. The Clear Voice function definitely increases the volume of voices, but I note a bit of hiss/noise during dialog.That’s all I’ve got for now. Again, good for small spaces, uncomplicated set up, good value. It’s no replacement for a surround sound system, of course. Will edit if I have any other problems.","Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2019",AHVXK7IZOWG2R3SMWLKAS4SHOPZA,True,79,Style: YAS-109BL
R3ULQY922SDP3Y,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars A unit that allows auto shutoff disabled!,William A. Ryder,5,"Ok here's what you should be looking for that I couldn't find anywhere. This unit *does* allow the stupid energy star auto shutoff to be disabled! Yes it sound quality is great for the price point. ARC works well.But I bought it to replace a JBL Soundbar 2.1 which after about 5 minutes of no sound, like when looking for a video on youtube via Roku, the soundbar shuts off! Now I need to duck around with the TV and the bar to turn it back on once I figure out why my volume went up so high (because it's the TV speakers). Believe me you do not want all this. It's unusable! And JBL will NOT let you turn this ""feature"" off. Any manufacturer who forces this situation is producing unusable GARBAGE.Then you go try to find in stated features where anyone else will let you shut it off. It's very hard to find out. It's like they don't want you to know, or to advertise, if a manufacturer builds in a way to disable this energy star auto shutoffoff because the energy police might come get them. I'm the first one to care about the environment but if it causes you to be forced to buy equipment that just doesn't work adequately, what's the point? Just ban the equipment then. Don't make us spend hundreds of dollars just so we can pull all of our hair out everyday when the stupid thing shuts off in the middle of normal use.So this Yamaha *does* allow the stupid auto shutoff to be disabled. It's working flawlessly with my new Sony x900h. It turns on and off with the TV using HDMI ARC which is exactly what you want and expect. And that's it. Simple. Effective. Worth the price.The only other I found that do this for sure seem to be the Bose units...but you're going to pay way up for those. There are a long list of manufacturers like JBL that don't let you disable anything about energy star...and so they will shut off on you and you just have to like it I guess. Heck with what the consumer wants. So if you want to find out who supports or not the only way I've found is reading owner's manuals to see if the setting is there. Most I checked don't have it.Buy this Yamaha if you just want to be safe and don't want to deal with all that kind of crap. I'm confirming for you that Yamaha gives you the control you want. And if you want a brand new nice sounding JBL unit for real cheap drop me a line. It made me cry for letting me down like this. Thank goodness for Yamaha.","Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2020",AHMBPHTL62BV6G6UXCD3DAPWLHHA,True,57,Style: YAS-209BL
R3CQ72Z3XXJ410,B07T5GGR8L,3.0 out of 5 stars OK soundbar. Only real option if you want to use an existing subwoofer and also want ARC.,AmazonUser,3,"I had recently upgraded to a 4k TV and had an old vizio soundbar that worked just fine but upon receiving the new tv, found that I would have to use 2 remotes which I absolutely did not want to do. I have the Polk Audio PSW10 subwoofer and wanted to continue using it as I really like the deep punch it has for movie action scenes. Many of the new soundbar packages don't allow an additional subwoofer option and the included sub seems inferior - typical seems to be 6"".Based on these criteria, there were not a whole lot of options available - a soundbar with a sub pre-out and HDMI ARC to enable the one remote option.So I settled on the YAS-109. Through some trial and error I found that the best settings (along with the additional sub) were Clear voice On, TV mode, subwoofer set to -1 and bass ext off.Other than not being able to get very loud compared to my old soundbar, they do the job alright. I just watched Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings in 4k; turning it up all the way and during action scenes, it almost makes me feel like I'm at a theater. The soundbar didn't give out at high volume and remained crystal clear. If however, I move to the kitchen 20 feet away, I wish I could turn up the volume more. Max volume is just not loud enough. My older Vizio soundbar got much louder but did choke at high volume. Perhaps they capped it on purpose knowing full well that the small speakers would not be able to handle anything louder.For the cons, the soundbar's speakers are so tiny that the 'subwoofer' is just a marketing gimmick. If turning up the soundbar's subwoofer at all, it just cannot handle the bass and makes any speech drowned out & woofy. If anything they should have called them drivers. Just by adding an air port doesn't qualify them being called a subwoofer; subwoofer is misleading.The other huge con is the 3d surround option. It is just so laughably bad. No clue how that got greenlighted. Turning it on makes the sound 'appear' wider but it loses all bass and sounds tinny like the speakers within the TV itself. It would have been nice to have the same bass and sound response as without it- but just appear to sound wider; my old vizio soundbar from 2008 had this option and performed so much better in this regard.I also don't really get the sound profiles. Game, Movie and Music have an echo but TV doesn't. Really weird.I can't comment on the Alexa option because we already have another Alexa speaker close by and didn't want them competing so turned the mic off. I also did turn off the power save option so it wouldn't go to sleep. It does turn off when I turn the TV off which is nice.For the current options out there right now, this sound bar is OK. It does the job and fulfilled my criteria. Does it blow me away? lol no. It doesn't have any of the new tech like DTS X or Dolby Atmos but then again it cost a fraction of the price as the ones that do so I can't complain re that.I think a good price point for this speaker is ~$150; abouts what I paid for it. Wait for a sale or try to find it used - like new (damaged box or return but still new). Definitely not worth the $220 new it's going for now.","Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2021",AGII3DOANTJUWG7DBMMAB2EFAZRA,True,23,Style: YAS-109BL

RCOEVRKAHUVEM,B07T5GGR8L,4.0 out of 5 stars Wouldn't buy it again....wish I could return it - update 2023 - maybe it was the TV?,Colauhu,4,"I read so many reviews about sound bars and this one received mostly nothing but praise. I don't understand why. I am not audiophile, but here are my impressions so far:]Sound always sound muffled and inconsistent in volume. I am watching something, then all of the sudden I have to turn the volume up/down because the show gets too quiet or loud. I can't understand half of what the show says unless I turn the volume up about half way. Using that ""clear voice"" feature is awful. It brings too much separation to the voices from the background of anything I am watching.Woofer - I guess if you really like bass. I hate it. It always sounds like there is this little background thumping sound. It doesn't add to the experience but quite the opposite. It sounds like some idiot with a car full of woofers is sitting in front of my house with his stereo cranked up that I can hear just enough to be annoyed by it.Whatever the ""3D audio is"" - it makes everything sound really weird and kind of hollow no matter what mode I use it in. It's ok for sports but that's about the only thing i've used it for so far.I try to keep the settings on Movie mode but I am constantly having to fiddle with settings depending on what I am watching.Overall I feel like this particular sound bar really detracts from my experience. I wish I could return it an purchase something else. My 10 year old Yamaha sound bar sounds much better. Maybe once the speakers have time to break in it will change my opinion, but until then, be prepared to be constantly fiddling the settings and volume level for every show to find one that is moderately acceptable.So, update to my original review. First of all, TCL is about the crappiest brand of TV I have ever owned. Will never purchase another one of their products ever again. 65"" TV developed a fault after 11 months, and they replaced it with a refurbished unit that lasted 3 months and totally died and naturally they didn't care, just told me basically that I was out of luck. I had to buy a new TV. This time I purchased a Samsung Q70A. Beautiful TV. As soon as I hooked it up to the sound bar, it sounded great. It was not muffled; you don't have to turn the volume up to literally 55 or 60 to hear the sound. Since I was convinced the sound bar was the problem, when I ordered the TV I also ordered a new Samsung sound bar for the ""symphony"" feature, but at least now I have this one as a backup.","Reviewed in the United States November 19, 2021",AHXFAG2M6BMMQNHL75WWSETQZ3UQ,True,13,Style: YAS-209BL

R24ZDLY0N72IL0,B07T5GGR8L,3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound quality above its price range; app & remote are subpar; power-save feature annoying,Jon Bates,3,"If you’re looking for a soundbar with integrated subwoofer and 3D sound with price as your top consideration, the overall audio quality is much better than others in this price range (both in television/movie context and when playing music through the bar). The breadth of input options is a big plus, and the placement of inputs as well as a ‘notch’ indentation at the top-rear of the soundbar makes it extremely convenient to access the two HDMI ports, optical audio port, ethernet connection and USB port (of value if you’re someone who prefers to do manual firmware updates) without unmounting the entire bar if you need to swap cables or add a connection.The WiFi setup process was straightforward and I was able to do it on the first attempt; WiFi connectivity has been stable and without any of the disconnections or repeated hassle of re-entering credentials that makes so many devices a hassle to own.Unfortunately, the mobile apps (Android/iOS) are terrible; I installed the app on both platforms, and neither make it easy to manage and control this soundbar from your phone or tablet. The interface is primitive, and Yamaha clearly did not invest much effort in thinking about how to organize the app. There is nothing intuitive about the icons, their placement, identifying what is informational vs. an icon you click to see additional options. I’m sure Yamaha saw integration with Alexa, Tidal, Spotify and QQ Music as valuable features to market this product, but I would easily trade whatever limited benefit these integrations offer for an app that didn’t require me to guess where to click (and then navigate three clicks deep into the app) just to get to the screen where controls for 3D Surround, Sound Program, Clear Voice option and Subwoofer Volume are buried.Finally, this soundbar includes a power-saving mode that turns the speaker off when you haven’t interacted with it via the remote or app for a while. Because there is no control I’ve been able to find in the app or on the remote to disable the power-saving more—or adjust the amount of time before it shuts off—I have had several infuriating moments when streaming a couple episodes of a series when the soundbar would turn off. More frustrating is that I connect the bar to my television via HDMI, with the soundbar connected between my TV and streaming box. When it abruptly powers off, it triggers the TV to try to find another input source and/or turns off my streaming box.The workaround is kind of ridiculous: every 15-20 minutes, I have to remember to push a button on the remote whether or not I need to adjust something. If I forget and I’m watching something that runs over an hour, I’m going to have to go through the hassle of powering it back on, switching my TV input back to HDMI, and so forth. It’s a great idea in terms of conserving power consumption, but Yamaha should know better than to integrate a feature without any user controls to disable or change the time before it goes off.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2022",AFUG2HCLSHAU7P34OFFSUJDQYT4A,True,18,Style: YAS-109BL
R1GQS0IQQH66OZ,B07T5GGR8L,"3.0 out of 5 stars Soundbar - Good, Suport, Setup - Not So Much",Wayne T.,3,"I found the sound quality of the unit to be pretty good for the price. However, the setup instructions for network connection and Alexa setup need some work. In the first place, having to download and use a mobile app is awkward, cumbersome and uses precious memory on my phone. Why they don't supply a Windows app that can be used on a wireless computer is beyond me. Secondly, the instructions in the setup guide are minimal to the point of incomplete. Here are the instructions for Alexa setup.An Amazon account is required to use Amazon Alexa and the unitmust be connected to a network. Use the Sound Bar Controller app toenter your Amazon account information and log into the service.However, the instructions on how to connect to the network were vague and incomplete. They did not mention that first you have to connect the mobile device to the soundbar's private wireless network and use that to find your wireless network with internet access to complete the process. I started a live chat with Yamaha tech support to try to get help but the support agent kept telling me to log on to my Amazon account (which can only be done over my home network, not the soundbar's network). The support person was of absolutely no help and finally told me he was escalating my problem to a higher level tech who would call me in 24-48 hours. He provided me with a case number for reference. I asked him to email me a transcript of the chat so I could reference the case number. But when I got the email, he had only sent the first half of the chat and the case number was not present so I had no way to provide it to the next agent to whom I spoke.In the meantime I continued to try to access my wireless network and set up the soundbar. At some point in the process I received a message on my phone that said that my phone was ""connected to Netname, the soundbar was connected to Netname, please connect the phone to Netname."" Netname being the name of my wireless net. So I was being told to connect my phone to the net to which it was already connected.At this point I decided that the soundbar had gotten into a state where I could proceed and disconnected/reconnected the power to the unit. I think this step enabled what happened next.By trial and error I finally deduced that to connect to my wireless network I had to use the soundbar's private network to find my wireless network and then enter the SSID and password. Once I did this, everything started working. When the next level tech called 2 days later, I told him that all had been resolved.From this I would say that:1. The mobile app should be improved with better instructions2. The setup guide should be improved with better instructions including pictures/screenshots3. The reference manual should be improved with better instructions, the including pictures/screenshots4. The tech support people should be better trained to listen to customers and be more knowledgeable in order to better serve the customers. They should also be trained in how to copy/paste so that complete transcripts are provided to the customer.5. A Windows app should be made available to provide a more easily used procedure to set up the soundbar.","Reviewed in the United States November 7, 2020",AGWJJQUHFPT7TO7QT7VEUL4ZSVVA,True,1,Style: YAS-109BL

R3E1XUGIKBB92J,B07T5GGR8L,"5.0 out of 5 stars Sound Clarity, Yes...",Don A,5,"Bottom line before my review...buy it!We are currently using the Yamaha YAS-109 sound bar for dual purpose; outside and RV. Under our RV-Port I like to here music when outside working and this is an great option. It can stream music from our house WiFi or from music via bluetooth on my phone. Having ALEXA in the unit (works only with internet connection), it's nice to get updates, change the music selection all with voice control. Surprisingly, under a metal RV port 24' x 40' with 15' ceiling, there is no problem hearing the music clearly. I move it from RV port to Car port with the same results and fairly quick connection to our house internet for WiFi streaming after re-plugging it in to AC power; less than 1 minute. The second accomplishment for us was to obtain better sound quality in our Truck Camper from the HDTV and music source. We power the unit from our batteries and inverter when dry camping and always have great music now! Via a bluetooth device connected on the back of the DISH satellite receiver (optional from Amazon) the Yamaha sound bar connects for great sound wireless anywhere we are parked. You can also use the HDMI connection from the HDTV to the Sound Bar if you don't want to 'pair' wireless technology. Pairing does require a smart phone one-time to connect the unit to a voice/music source. So far, re-pairing has 'not' been necessary after power has been removed. Therefore, in our case, pair once and power up and listen to your source music or TV programming. Since 100% of our camper is powered off a 3000 watt inverter (back feed on all 120 vac outlets), we watch satellite TV and use Sirius XM music from DISH TV over the sound bar in the middle of no where! If you have a Sirius XM account (i.e. in your vehicle or house), you can connect ALEXA, set up via a CODE and stream Sirius XM programming from your house or other WiFi connection; no additional fees. All you need to do is say...""ALEXA, play the BLEND on Sirius XM"" or ""play the top play list on Amazon Music"" and you're on your way! Instruction manual is not the greatest but should get you connected. This unit can also be purchased with a bass sub-woofer for house use. Oh, the unit can be mounted on a wall vertical (template included) or sit flat on a counter or entertainment center. In my RV case, I had to weld up brackets to hold on the rear-mounting screws and cradle the bottom due to the wall angle. Initially, I contacted Yamaha for a support question regarding ALEXA (couldn't reconnect), referred to 2nd level support which via email took over a week; Not Good! In the mean time, found out ALEXA has an ON/OFF button on the units control panel...make sure it's turned ON for 'voice' control. No, it's not a $1000+ BOSE surround system like we have in the house but it is a 'major' improvement for those that want something much smaller, affordable and still produce great sound. We are glad we selected this Yamaha Sound Bar and hope you do also!Update: 7 months later, works great!","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2019",AFAQPKW6LLD2A2NO7BALA2HU25BQ,True,35,Style: YAS-109BL

This sound system would not do things like ""go to Netflix"" or ""rewind"" or the usual things we use our Alexa fire cube for. I tried putting the cube in line with the sound bar, but that didn't work either. The fire cube would no longer do its usual functions. Once the sound bar was disconnected, and the fire cube directly hooked to the TV, the Alexa functions were back to normal. I had to return my sound bar because of these issues.

I have some hearing loss so this allows me to hear more clearly with the volume lower than just using the TV speakers or switching to bluetooth headphones. If the controller gets misplaced by tiny hands I can control the volume and audio settings from my phone using the app.The Bad:Does not support Enhanced AC3 also known as Dolby Digital Plus, DD+, E-AC-3, and EC-3. This format is becoming much more common. You'll get no audio and will have to power off the soundbar or potentially disable audio passthrough which should encode the audio to a supported format. I'm not sure how to do this currently and your mileage may vary depending on hardware and software, but I don't think this is done at the soundbar.Finally, Issues with the app. The soundbar will randomly stop being detected by the app even though the soundbar is connected to my home network using ethernet (hardwired not WiFi). This happens often enough to be a nuisance and from what I've read has been a problem for a while with the APP. Apparently the only fix is to reset the device and readd to the APP each time this happens.","Reviewed in the United States March 10, 2023",AGISU4JNZZGA2R57ZSLQQOUMKC6A,True,7,Style: YAS-209BL

RTXPX0WY34TCS,B07T5GGR8L,4.0 out of 5 stars Good clear sound,Ian F. White,4,"I had an older IG soundbars and wanted to upgrade. I read dozens of reviews and tests. For my budget this seemed perfect. Very easy to set up and connect to internet and Bluetooth. Chose a 4K blu ray film to watch. After playing with the settings I settled on movie and +3 subwoofer along with clear voice and 3D surround. I was very happy with the sound production. My one small criticism is that the surround sound could be more pronounced. Not enough separation between left and right channels. Base is just right. Not too overpowering. Music was really good as well, played via Bluetooth and my iPhone.I’d recommend this for anyone on a budget. Dolby atmos would have been nice but beggars can’t be choosers! 😄I’ve had this sound bar for some time now and thought I’d update my review.To be honest I’m a little disappointed. To hear it reasonably it needs to be at least half full volume and even with clear voice turned on it’s still sometimes difficult to understand every word that’s said. The subwoofer is my main moan. I have it turned to +4 (the maximum as it starts at ~4, goes to 0 and then +4) and once you’ve gotten used to it…an hour or so, it seems to disappear into the background. There are no dramatic booms and bangs while watching an action movie. This is a big subwoofer as they go and the sound seems weak.Overall, if I was a rich man I’d go out and buy something more powerful. If you buy this, don’t expect wonders although it is an improvement on the TV speakers.","Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2021",AFC74CNI74OWBOY6TPLDJIHLZWDA,True,0,Style: YAS-209BL

To be honest this is the best sounding sound bar I’ve ever heard in my life I’ve heard some very expensive soundbars with similar quality of sound. If you are looking for amazing sound quality I’d recommend these. The bass is very nice and the vocals are loud and including whatever else is going on in the background it picks up everything very nicely. Almost makes you believe you got a surround sound and not a soundbar. Anyways if you buy this you won’t regret it.

R1NIF2UCRBCJAA,B07T5GGR8L,3.0 out of 5 stars The sound isn't bad but the functionality leave much to be desired,AnAmazonShopper,3,"I originally had this in my apartment, hanging on the wall, behind my couch, and connected to my projector via optical cable. Alexa had issues with staying connected. However, I didn't use Alexa very much with it so it didn't really bother me. Since then, I have gotten a house and moved the sound bar to my home gym to connect to the TV mounted in there and for music. Now, I use Alexa all the time. The problem is, I want to say, Alexa, play music everywhere so it plays on all of my alexa devices in the house. This speaker doesn't show up on the list of available speakers. Which is a huge bummer. So this sound bar will probably be relegated to the basement TV which doesn't really get any use.As a stand-alone alexa device, it isnt't bad. However, if you want to integrate it into a smart home setup, you'll probably want to skip it. It is worth mentioning that since we moved, I haven't had any connectivity issues with it. Maybe because my internet is more stable here than it was in my apartment and my modem doesn't go out all the time. It can be a real pain to get this sound bar connected to the internet.The sound from the bar is pretty good, I can't really give it more than 3 stars, because it doesn't go above any average expectation I had for the price.If you're using it for movies, you'll want a wired connection. There is a lot of lag, especially with youtube, and no way to set a delay of any kind to compensate for it. Bluetooth for movies or videos is complete rubbish, bluetooth on this device should only be used for music, or audiobooks. In which case, you have Alexa and amazon music integration.In sum,If you want a good-sounding bar, with a wired connection for movies, and maybe some audio streaming then this is probably a good fit for you.If you're hoping for any kind of smarthome integration, or an wireless-audio option to bluetooth to your Kindle FireTV Stick (or preferred home streaming media device) I can not recommend it. The audio lag is a deal breaker if that's your intended use.","Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2020",AHQ3KDLYMG65R4ACOY23L6R3RHDQ,True,1,Style: YAS-109BL

Took a lot of trial and error to figure this out and so far the only way to get the sound from the TV to the Soundbar working again is to unplug everything. I have easy access to my surge protector so it's not a big deal and easy to power down and back up again. I'm not sure if this setup is supposed to work so I'm not really complaining because the dual sound outputs work for me.I also have the soundbar connected to my old Polk PSW505 base speaker via standard RCA audio cable and WOW does the base POP.

No equalizer nor even bass treble etc. Just volume control for the sub and audio ""scenes"" (ie movie, TV show, music) with no explanation what they do.With everything set up for ARC the soundbar turns completely off - not to standby - when turning the TV off. So ARC won't turn the soundbar back on. Edit: found instructions online for disabling this feature.And physically speaking if your TV is mounted on the wall you can't mount the soundbar right up under it because of the way it mounts. And the soundbar buttons are on the TOP of the soundbar instead of the end or front. So if you want to be able to use the physical buttons or see the indicator lights you'll have to leave a few inches of space between the TV and soundbar.And if you're like me and like good wire management, this thing sucks. They don't give you a channel on the back to give space between the wall and soundbar to run wires. And the power cord has to be bent at a harsh angle so it doesn't hit the wall. There are no brackets you just hang it on two screws in the wall, so it's not very secure. And good luck getting it level because of the cheap way they designed the mounts. And of course the bottom is ugly which sucks if you mount it to the wall. They clearly paid zero attention to the design for people who will actually mount it to a wall.","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2022",AFOWK6JTP73AJEPBSWYOTK3OV6CA,True,2,Style: YAS-209BL

Downloading the app, updating the firmware helped some of this, but it still sometimes shut off and wouldn't respond or turn back on using arc or even it's remote. Swapping sources on the app once or twice would generally wake it back up, but it is still a tedious. I did some hard googling and found the auto shutoff could be turned off. Just google ""turn off yas 209 auto shutoff"". It's the Input button i think and the power button for 5 seconds and the clearvoice icon start to glow which means it's disabled. I now no longer wanted to return it. It's a great sounding bar that get pretty loud and the bass ext really adds a solid low end. After reading other reviews as annoyed as I was I hope this helps some people. It's honestly a really good soundbar and it's too bad these small changes aren't openly presented as I imagine a lot of people would enjoy it a lot more.

R2GRRCSVRM4919,B07T5GGR8L,3.0 out of 5 stars You can do much better sonically,Roger Moffatt,3,"My wife hates wires, oh and large speakers, so was on the hunt for a relatively wire free soundbar based audio system for our new house and second TV room. Setup was relatively pain-free, although had to resort to reading instructions for getting it connected to my local mesh network which is 5G/2.4G. Functionality wise this is pretty neat - the built in Alexa integration works well, although can't seem to change the wake word as I can with the other devices around the house - but that's no bad thing as at least when I talk to Alexa, only the sound bar gets the instruction. Like the independent sub-woofer controls and it all looks the part and has fewer wires than my previous system. So why only 3 stars? In our house the competition is a small class-D digital amplifier and a pair of floor standing speakers (hence all the wires) and it completely wipes the floor with the Yamaha sonically. Yes the subwoofer is nice, but the mid-range is completely muddled regardless of what EQ setting (Movie/TV/Music/Sports/Game/Stereo) and the sound stage is surprisingly narrow. Disappointing I'd say. That said, it is of course a huge step up from the TV speakers and also a huge improvement over a previous basic soundbar we tried that lasted a week before I couldn't bear the sound any more, so it's not terrible - but by comparison with a real hi-fi system, despite the technology and the number of drivers, it makes a bit of a mess of the sound to my ears. I'm going to keep it for now, but relegate to our second TV rather than the one we would use more of the time.

I was a little worried looking at some of the reviews mentioning issues and needing to hard wire, etc. None of that for me. Plugged it in, installed the Yamaha app, everything automatically detected, Alexa setup only took a couple clicks, and firmware updated automatically. Then I was off to the running.Sound: Honestly, I'm not audiophile but I can tell the difference between low quality bass heavy speakers and something that produces quality sound. This sound bar isn't as amazing as my $2000 5.1 system but I very much find myself wondering if I need it based on the performance of this system I just installed in my vacation home. It's clean, minimalistic on space, and produces crisp and well rounded sound. This is also placed in my great room and has no issues filling the large space with sound.Alexa integration: I'm heavily invested in Alexa. I have them everywhere. The voice activation works flawlessly so far and she's picked up my voice without issue. After reading some reviews I was worried it would be a clunky integration but this has not been the case. It just works, same as any other echo I have.Controls: The capacitive touch buttons on the bar and remote work without issue. I did have to manually switch over to the TV input to get the ARC passthrough to work but it's been fine ever since.Overall this is a quality system and lives up to the reviews. If you want a hi-fi Alexa that also works great for home theater I'd have a hard time coming up with any other features I'd need that aren't already in this package. This is easily worth the price and I'd probably have paid a little more.

RA8CDPXXMU84A,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars My PC outputs to the ATS-2090 via optical,Rob D,5,"I wanted something better than the weak desktop speaker offerings typically used for my PC... I looked at various speaker types and designs until I found this design by Yamaha, ATS-2090. Since I wanted a solid quality sound at my desk and not wanting a dedicated stereo in my office, a sound bar seemed the best solution. The audio ""out"" from the PC and the HDMI ""in"" on the sound bar apparently aren't compatible, but both devices have optical... which windows 11 calls Digital Audio (S/PDIF), Toshiba invented it back in 1983 (TOSLINK). My ASUS mobo has it and the ATS-2090 has it, so music fills my office. The ATS-2090 also has Alexa, so music sources are not limited to the PC. I mounted the soundbar under my desk with the provided mounting template and the subwoofer sits on the floor under my desk. I installed the Yamaha sound bar app on my phone, and the included remote work equally well to control the volume and modes, as well as keeping track of any software updates available for Alexa or the ATS-2090. I am very happy that I chose the Yamaha ATS-2090 as my speaker and Alexa controlling the blacklight and lava lamp in my office (via a smart outlet) is just the icing on the cake. My video game sounds are on the next level when the headset starts to make my head hurt...

R3O1SH7YHU2677,B07T5GGR8L,4.0 out of 5 stars Works fine if you avoid the app,real person reviewer,4,"All I wanted was a soundbar to replace my (much better and more expensive) dinosaur that doesn't do newer audio formats, and I wanted one that has an actual subwoofer out for my old school wired subwoofers. I'm not doing any Alexa or apps or software updates or anything. I just plugged it into my TV via the optical cable and my two subwoofers (one on each side of the room, with a splitter cable to connect them both to the single sub out). I have a big living room, and the sound is satisfactory. It's not as surround-sound as the much more expensive but dated soundbar I used to use, but it cost less than $250. I like how the remote lets you control both the sub and soundbar volume independently, and that I don't have to bother with the app (which everyone seems to hate). I can now play a Netflix show without having to manually change the audio format every single episode, and I didn't have to spend a ton of money to update my entire setup to do it. It took me about 10 minutes to switch it out, and it's worked without a glitch for a couple of weeks now. That's good enough for 4 stars in my book.

At first, the soundbar kept connecting to the TV with bluetooth and not HDMI ARC. Frustrating for a good while to the point where I actually packed up the soundbar to return it. Then I decided to give it another try. I fished for answers in the manual ( which is not greatly clear) and found out that I needed to reset the soundbar and, boom, got the ARC set up. In fairness the soundbar was previously used so it may have needed the reset. Still the fix was a bit elusive. I had a subwoofer on hand from my 5.1 surround sound set, and hooked it up to the soundbar. Now, finally, the sound is pleasing with great depth. Big improvement from TV speakers. Still miss my 5.1 set up, but don't miss the wires. Now everything is compact, behind the TV. For $170, like new I am very happy. Took a star off for the frustrating set up, but the soundbar itself is very, very good. Doesn't beat a 5.1 setup of course, but very good for what it does.

I had read many of the previous reviews, which influenced my purchase. Our LG TV is on a swing-arm wall mount, so we had to attach the Yamaha to the bottom of the TV using a special bracket, which Amazon helpfully suggested. That was fine.Have not managed, after several weeks, to really figure out how to modulate the volume control, in terms of the voice thing, the subwoofer, the volume control on LG remote, the volume control on Yamaha remote, etc. The owners manual, such as it is, is beyond worthless.So, when music plays on a TV show, it's like you're in a concert hall. 5 seconds later, the music has subsided and a character on the TV show is talking, and you can barely hear them. So then you grab the Yamaha remote and try hitting the voice button and all that, and you don't really know if it's engaging, because there's nothing but some inscrutable lights flashing at the base of the unit.I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually.

R3UAXTHK99QQVI,B07T5GGR8L,3.0 out of 5 stars Adequate,Ryan,3,"It's been a year since we bought it, so I figure it's time for a year's ownership review. I purchased this because listening to the TV's speakers was just awful and it allowed me to make use of my Klipsch sub woofer that was collecting dust. With the addition of my sub, it just adds a dimension to the sound that isn't achievable by itself. The lows by itself are fine for a bedroom (get a sub for your living room), the mids are nice, and the highs are ""Tin'y"" sounding. The sound adjustments help somewhat, but ultimately there is no escaping that ""tin'y"" sound with the highs. It's hard to find a happy medium between sound effects and people speaking in movies. Voices seem to get lost a lot, even with a lot of adjusting. The remote is almost worthless if you've got it sitting on an entertainment center, so we just use the app. Alexa is hit or miss, we usually end up repeating ourselves and if we're listening to a program, forget it, it struggles to hear you. I know this all sounds bad, but it's not...not really. For the price, I'm actually content with it for the most part. It's not a living room solution though. If I had to do it again, I'd have gone Bose or Sonos. That said, it'll make a nice upgrade for the bedroom when I order a higher end system.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2022",AFBWDERTAKGOTX4PXVNOMFNOXHEQ,True,0,Style: YAS-109BL

We listen to music a lot on TV, Alexa or through external inputs like DVD. Sound quality is great and clear. For watching movies, the surround sound is great.I had however lots of problems with TV and Alexa getting frequently disconnected until I figured out solution hard way. I have connected to our late model Samsung TV through ARC. There is some combination of turning on- off Alexa and Tv sounds that disconnects from the source. Then I have to reset the soundbar which the user guide does not tell you how. Also the you have to know how to reconnect the Alexa using mobile app if the network gets disconnected. All these, once you learn how, are manageable but require some technical expertise.Here is the frustration part. Yamaha tech support is very poor, a 1 star at best. I called them 5-6 times and each time the wait is 1-1.5 hr! They do not have an efficient queuing system. The recorded message which is an advertisement for their drum based products is extremely annoying. If you keep the volume on your phone low, when the tech support comes on, you may not hear them and they just hang up after your hour long wait! Also the tech support only showed me how to reset the soundbar but could not help on Alexa. She said she will have to an audio specialist call me which they never did.The firmware on mobile app says it is version 1.0.6. But if you check on the website, there is a version 2.76 available which supposedly fixes lot of these issues. The tech support does not know anything about it! I went through the process of updating the firmware however the mobile app still shows old version only!

R8N4YX8H6OVC,B07T5GGR8L,4.0 out of 5 stars A very good soundbar that is not without flaws,Brett,4,"Update 9/12/19: There’s a firmware update that I swear adds significantly more bass to the system (am I imagining this?) and appears to address the sound skips. Curious to see what others say.Original review: I started with a Sonos Beam but was unimpressed with the audio quality. I next tried the $700 Samsung Q70R, which sounded really good on Atmos, but had tinny vocals on standard content and a lip sync delay that I couldn't fix. So third time is the charm, but not without issues. The Yamaha sounds very good when you set it to Movie mode, turn the sub to max, turn on bass extension and turn on Clear Voice. Most importantly, it just works! The lip sync is perfect, it turns to the correct mode every time, and the power and volume can be controlled by the Apple Tv remote no problem. The major issue is, if you only use ARC, the audio cuts off for a few seconds every so often. This has been mentioned in other reviews, so it's a clear problem that Yamaha needs to address. The current solution to this is to plug Arc from the bar to the Tv and then to use a second HDMI cable from the bar to your source. 95% of the content I watch is on Apple Tv, so this is fine, but if I want to use the PS4 without audio skips, I need to unplug the HDMI from the Apple Tv and hook it up to the PS4, which is a pain. Also, the app is terrible. I can only get it to even connect if I link my phone wifi to the bar, as opposed to my home network. Of the three bars I tried, this is easily my favorite, and the cheapest. It's a good value. But Yamaha definitely needs a firmware update for the Arc audio issue.","Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2019",AFGDNXCQ5ERYP42XZ63MTS5WGUCA,True,153,Style: YAS-209BL

Often have to repeat myself, or it will hear the wake word, and immediately beep off as if it doesn't think anyone is talking.I cant seem to control Alexa's volume independently of the soundbar. At normal volume (just watching tv) she's too quiet. But If I turn the volume up... she's way to loud.2. The included remote is kinda chintzy. I would like to see a universal remote included, for people who might hook this up via toslink. I use CEC over HDMI which mostly works great.Audio quality is usually better than I expected.

Pretty much worth it in the end, though.A great product.

Most of the settings have a harsh treble setting, I leave it on stereo mostly bc it isn't so bad, but at high volumes none of the settings are pleasant, very harsh treble makes it hard to listen to for long.The woofer is pretty good but the low mids are lacking. The surround is really convincing but the treble levels make it hard to keep it in that setting for long. It is significantly better than the tv speakers though, and the Bluetooth is really well done, I can connect very easily and consistently from my phone. I haven't used the Alexa much but it does turn the volume up and down by voice command even at higher volumes, I'm impressed by that.

The sound is surprisingly good. As a professional sound engineer, clearly this is not a replacement for professional speakers in a large venue, but for a bedroom, it sounds very nice with surprisingly good bass for its size, and good vocal clarity. We have it switched to music mode all the time, obviously. The Alexa feature is convenient (moved the other Alexa to another room).However we are frustrated by two things. First the iPhone controller app seems to have trouble connecting to the sound bar. If I power down the sound bar, then power up again, it will connect for a few minutes and even play music. But if the app reloads for whatever reason, whether 5 minutes later or a day later, the app simply will not connect without restarting the sound bar. Yet (get this), audio continues to play from the phone over WiFi! In fact, we couldn't STOP audio from playing because the app couldn't find the sound bar it was actually playing through at the time! Really? This happens every time and is completely repeatable. Was this app even tested? We finally gave up on using the app and moved to bluetooth, which brings up issue number 2....Apparently the sound bar can only connect to one bluetooth device at a time, which makes sense for playing music, but unlike other bluetooth products from other manufacturers, if my wife's phone is connected--even if she's not using that connection--there's no way I can connect to the speaker until she goes into her bluetooth settings and releases the connection by selecting disconnect. Yes, just choosing another output to play to is insufficient, you must go into the bluetooth settings and disconnect. That seems pretty hostile.Those are my two complaints.

There is a ""Clear Voice"" setting that you can turn on - it helps a bit with that issue, but if you need to have an artificial boost on frequencies for dialogue, that might be a hint that the soundbar isn't quite up to snuff.I am utilizing the HDMI ARC feature - the only strange thing I have seen is that when the TV turns on, once in a while the sound bar will NOT turn on automatically with it. When it happens it is annoying, but manually turning the sound bar on fixes the issue, so it isn't terrible.All in all, if you are looking for a quality sound bar, this might be OK if you have a small room and have to hook up a subwoofer as well.

RGHC3B0FUYXAP,B07T5GGR8L,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, but bad support and poor design features",slackersan,2,"Would not recommend. Nice, high quality sound, but if you have trouble the tech support and documentation is appallingly bad, and based on the issues with my Roku, the manual is probably inaccurate. No volume indicator on the soundbar and poorly designed remote.Pros:I bought this to replace an old 5.1 system I had. The sound is very impressive. It's not true surround sound, of course, but I love the sound.Cons:1. Extremely lacking manual and poor tech support.I followed the extremely minimal directions but my installation had a problem with the sound dropping out every few minutes. The manual is basically really just an illustration. There's no FAQ or troubleshooting info. So it was no help. The online video is mostly a sales video. Again, no help there.So I called tech support. Their solution was to replace my HDMI cables. Seriously?! Well, fortunately I had spares, so I did, but as I expected it didn't make any difference. Basically, the only solution tech support could offer was the equivalent of turning the system on and off (Something else I did.), so tech support was no help and a waste of my time.Eventually, I fixed it on my own. Their manual says to run the HDMI cable to the sound bar from your streaming box (I have a Roku.). That's not the set up I had on my 5.1 system. So I went back to my former set up, running my Roku HDMI to my TV not the Yamaha sound bar.That fixed it. No thanks to Yamaha.2. Poor soundbar designThere's no volume gauge on the soundbar. No volume level indicator. No numbers. No volume bar. Just an indication the volume is going up or down, so you have no idea what your volume level is. I guess they expect you to use the iphone app. But I prefer using the remote that comes with it. Imagine that.3. The remote is poorly designedThe volume control is at the bottom of the remote, so rather than the remote resting in the palm of your hand you have to hold it in your fingers.Verdict:I do not recommend. Nice, high quality sound, but if you have trouble the tech support and documentation is appallingly bad. And based on the issues with my Roku, the manual is probably inaccurate. No volume indicator and poorly designed remote.I would have sent the system back, but it's honestly a hassle to repackage.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2021",AGHJO3F6VGG7F5WJB5U246FF7SNQ,True,1,Style: YAS-209BL

R2B05ZYA5ZWD89,B07T5GGR8L,2.0 out of 5 stars Way too sibilant,E,2,"I was hoping this soundbar would be a decent option for TV, music, etc., given that Yamaha has a lot of experience with making well-respected audio hardware. I found these really lacking in the lows and mids, and way too sharp in the highs. If you wanna hear every detail in every cymbal-hit in songs you didn't even realize had cymbals, this is the setup for you. If you want full, well-balanced sound, none of the 6 preset EQ options this sound bar offers will satisfy. And, if you're like me and can't stand sharp, piercing, noises whenever someone on TV says a word containing the letter ""s"", stay far away from this soundbar. Also, it felt like the subwoofer was too loud and boomy when I didn't want to hear it, but wasn't putting out enough when I did want to hear it.I really wanted this to be good enough. I wasn't expecting to be blown away, I just wanted something decent, but this just isn't it. I imagine all these 5-star reviewers haven't watched their TVs with anything other than the built-in speakers, and this is certainly better than TV speakers, but it's just not good enough to be charging almost $200. I will say, the virtual surround mode was somewhat impressive. It really did make the soundstage feel so much bigger, but it also added a lot of reverb and generally degraded the overall sound quality and clarity further. This was my first sound bar, so I don't know if this one's better or worse than other soundbars – it seems like it's really difficult to make tiny little speakers sound like they're not tiny little speakers – but I can confidently say that this soundbar is worse than stereo speakers that cost half the price or less.","Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2023",AFKPPUQI6WDOIEDDBNXIYXJXARXQ,True,2,Style: ATS-2090BL-R
RPEOEDN7F56ZJ,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Problems connecting to TV help,Dr. Clutch,5,"We bought our Yamaha YAS-109 for Christmas this year. I found it odd that it comes with an optical sound cable and the Quick Start Guide doesn’t mention the optical cable at all. Instead the Guide explains how to connect via HDMI, which is not included. The sound bar is HDMI ARC and CEC compatible so if your TV is also capable of these 2 features you should be able to control the sound bar volume from your TV remote. That was a major consideration when we chose this sound bar. When I finally got it working it was a major improvement over the TV’s built in speakers.Unfortunately, connecting it to our TV via HDMI ARC did not work. There was no sound from the TV and the TV’s CEC settings menu did not detect a CEC device connected. Lots of reading online and plenty of juggling settings and cables later I figured out that the cable box is interfering with the TV’s ability to detect the sound bar over the HDMI connection. If you have this problem you can disconnect all inputs to the TV except the sound bar and if the TV then detects the sound bar you can reconnect 1 TV input at a time until you find the offending device. Our TV is a TCL ROKU 5S series and the offending cable box is a Samsung SMT-H4372 originally from Time Warner. Until I can get a different cable box I am using the optical cable and the sound bar remote for volume control. Hope this helps someone with a similar problem.","Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2020",AGCHHNEDDRPBRZE6A23O46QGDUMA,True,3,Style: YAS-109BL

R2HWP05G32HEQR,B07T5GGR8L,1.0 out of 5 stars FAILED after 2 weeks....,CLG,1,"UPDATE: The soundbar abruptly stopped passing the HDMI signal in the middle of a movie after two weeks of light use and the screen went black and the sound stopped. Switching the setup to HDMI ARC audio only did not solve the audio problem. Troubleshooting isolated the problem to the HDMI output hardware. Clearly a quality control issue. Very very disappointed in Yamaha. Will be returning this and will get a different system (Yamaha no more).INITIAL REVIEW: First understand my star rating: 5 stars for home theater sound, 1 star for music = 3 stars. Yamaha is a brand I have loved for over 30 years for their great products in the music world, so when I was looking for a soundbar which could deliver both great home theater sound AND also music, I was drawn to this soundbar. If you are looking for a home theater experience and don't want to hassle with multiple speakers, it does a pretty good job (great clarity, good but not overwhelming bass, nice reproduction across the range); the virtual surround feature was a bit lost in my large room, but I blame the space, not the bar for that, and it was still a nice auditory experience. Sadly, music reproduction from bluetooth streaming sources was poor, due to harsh and often distorted treble at the mid to upper ranges on most tracks (rock, jazz, classical, acoustic), including on vocals. This was at its worst when using the 3D surround feature, but was not fixed by using either the ""music"", or ""stereo"" modes provided, or by a firmware update. There is no other equalizer option. Both Amazon Music HD and Apple iTunes files had the same issue. In contrast, when I connected my vinyl phonograph (TEAC TN300, using its built in pre-amp (RCA out, using an inexpensive RCA to TOS-Link converter, so I could make use of the only other single port (optical) on the bar...HDMI is the main of course), it did not have this problem and actually sounded very nice. Go figure, but I am guessing it has to do with the reproduction of the compressed (and undoubtedly loudness adjusted) digital streaming files through this unit vs. the more natural dynamic range of the analogue to digital signal from the vinyl. A bit disappointed on this front, because my plans are to use it both for music and TV. I am probably expecting too much at this price point, considering the feature set provided, but I wanted more from my old friend Yamaha. I don't use Alexa, so I can't comment on that. Set up was straight forward using the enclosed quick start guide, with easy pairing of the wireless sub. The iPhone control app is pretty worthless, as it offers far fewer features that the small physical remote provided. I will probably keep the bar for now and rely mostly on my vinyl collection for music in that space; still, its too bad that streaming will not be a great option.","Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2020",AGW4RPFBODN5WGKRCQ7M3FASEC6Q,True,10,Style: YAS-209BL

Should have sprung for the Sonos. Yamaha used to be a decent company, but they should be ashamed of this product and their customer service.Updated review: managed to get Alexa and wifi to work after some back and forth with Yamaha via email. It seems to be functioning just fine now, and the Alexa system works okay. Still, I'm not convinced this was a good buy. 1) There is no midrange and the sound from the bar is tinny, which is fine for voice but annoying for rock music. 2) The ""music"" setting appears to just add reverb. 3) There is no way to adjust the eq, which I realize is pretty normal for soundbars, but still annoys me. 4) The subwoofer isn't as tight as other reviews led me to believe, but rather muddy: again good for movies not for music. 5) When playing music on Alexa, it will randomly start playing again after I've told it to stop (our echo dot doesn't do this). 6) The wifi only works on 2.4 ghz, so to use the app on the smartphone, I first have to go into wifi settings and switch it from my default 5ghz network to my 2.4 ghz.I don't have the money for a nicer system right now, and at least we can finally hear the voices on TV/movies, so I guess this will have to do for a few years.","Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2019",AHJVZ7ORKEL4ORHIVXTLJYPFAQQQ,True,7,Style: YAS-209BL

Yamaha is a trusted brand but I'm pretty certain the people who designed the software and the app do not use this product themselves. Here is a list of issues that bug me everytime I use, and I mean, everytime: -1) the soundbar turns off by itself everytime you pause a movie for more than 5 minutes. Why? It's not like the soundbar is running on battery, is it? And when the soundbar is turned off, you'll have to restart the program again.2) the app's design is retarded. To set the program for TV, movie, etc. and to adjust the volume, you'll have to navigate through multiple screens everytime. Meanwhile, the volume adjustment occupies the entire phone screen for whatever reason. All these functions could easily have fit into a single screen. The app developer obviously have not learnt Human-Computer Interfaces. You're supposed to make it convenient and minimise the number of taps, not maximise it!3) the app does not remember your source of audio input. I have it on HDMI. Yet it will switch back to TV as the source everytime after it's turned off. Why? This is a soundbar, we care about the quality of our audio enough to buy a soundbar. Why would the source not be defaulted to HDMI but digital optical audio instead? Better still, remember our choices!4) I'm using the soundbar for my TV. I don't wait to navigate past your Spotify or whatevernot just so i can adjust the volume of the movie I am watching, and set the type of program. Why can't you just put the volume control as the first screen?5) the app could not be used when it's connected to other WiFi that has been inter-routed behind the scenes. My other WiFi connected appliances etc - security cameras, lightbulbs, switches and even my vacuum, are smart enough to not impede my WiFi setup but Yamaha? Why? You're the lone exception and that speaks a lot!6) why does the app need my location to operate? Again, here you're the lone exception! Invade privacy much?!7) the app will not reconnect if the WiFi is hidden. Why?8) the support is merely lips service.

Upon using it the second day, it stop having any sound coming from the TV. Arc shown it is still working as I can control with volume up or down but no sound at all. I switch to optical connection to the TV cause everything I tried couldn't bring the sound back. There really isn't much I can do. Optical work as intended but not preferred cause I don't want to use a second remote just for the sound when I am watching TV. Optical work for one session only. After I turn off the TV and return later to watch TV again, just like HDMI arc, it stop having any sound again. This time using Yamaha remote for sound doesn't do anything at all. I unplug the power source to the unit to do a ""reset"" and replug it after a short while, it work for a short time then it won't let me adjust any volume (using TV remote through HDMI arc or Yamaha remote) and then while the unit is able to have sound, all the light on the unit disappear.

R66PKTX66DVV7,B07T5GGR8L,4.0 out of 5 stars Sound is decent,Bernardo,4,Overall it’s not too bad of a sound bar. I purchased it because I wanted an Alexa enabled speaker that I can set up with other Alexa speakers to have sound throughout the house. That feature totally worked. I wasn’t too thrilled with the sound though. I wish there was more control with a custom EQ through the App. Currently it has preset EQ settings that sometimes does not sound that great. Either you can’t really hear the voices on a movie or it has just too much bass. I think if I could adjust the EQ manually this product would have received 5 stars throughout.,"Reviewed in the United States August 28, 2022",AFZEKAAJQII3FLEFGUBDAHTIE6IA,True,3,Style: YAS-209BL

The sound quality difference is incredible. Setup app works great and love having a built in Alexa. Only downside is how large the subwoofer is but worth it for the sound quality.,"Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2024",AHKHLAN5CNOSGJ7ML43AYFOIUSIA,True,0,Style: YAS-209BL
RR3JZ7KJ9JQSC,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Clear Voice works!,Mark P Hart,5,Best sound bar we have ever used. Sub woofer offers rich sound.

RN2AZGRPA0XY1,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Setup advice,Jeff Owens,5,"Works great, sounds great, price is great. Works just like an echo smart speaker regarding voice commands. For our small house and our use this product is a perfect. NOTE REGARDING SETUP. All the feedback about how hard setup is. All true. Poor documentation, and circular references. I was ready to return it and give up when I disconnected everything and setup as a stand alone device. Remove any HDMI, optical, or USB connection. When I did the app immediately found the soundbar, setup the WiFi, and the Alexa app added the speaker to inventory. Went from BUST to BARGAIN in 3 minutes.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2023",AF7HK46Z6EUEPB5ATXEHIKPPUTIQ,True,8,Style: ATS-2090BL-R
RDQM8WDC2D73B,B07T5GGR8L,"4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty Good, Could Be Better",S. Cooper,4,"Overall this sound bar has been enjoyable. It sometimes shuts itself off, seemingly for no reason but it could be related to an ""automatic standby"" setting that I have disabled so time will tell. The sound quality is good and this fixes my issue where the ""Smart Sound"" on my LG Smart TV makes dialogue completely unintelligible on Blu-rays and HD streaming with surround sound; I can now always hear the dialogue perfectly clear. The 3D settings isn't very desirable and just makes everything sound muddy and extra bass-heavy so I don't really understand the point. The ARC HDMI functionality works well but it doesn't turn on with my TV. My one main complaint is that it takes a long time to move the volume either up or down and there is no digital display so you have to go by the amount of LEDs lit on the unit—not very telling when each LED represents 3 different volumes.","Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2021",AEI5EMRDKBBXMO3G3GFELR5ZHK4A,True,0,Style: YAS-109BL
R281N5NOVK03GV,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Simple - sounds good - speech enhancement works.,Photomagica,5,"I plugged this into a TV with HDMI Arc and it came on and has worked perfectly since. Speech enhancement works very well, though it adds a slight harsh quality to the sound. Still it is absolutely needed on the too many shows where the characters mumble or speak in near whispers. Of course YMMV depending upon your hearing.When I purchased this I did not know it came with screw sockets on the back to mount it on the wall and a template to mark the wall for mounting. So - I put two screws in the wall under the TV and done. Nice!I found that the sound is better with the bar on the wall - the wide face facing the viewers - rather than narrow edge-on sitting on a console under the TV. I also tried it edge-on above the TV and this was slightly worse than edge-on under the TV. The differences weren't huge, just noticeable.Is this as good as a A/V receiver with multiple high quality speakers? (I have a system like that too.) No! That said, it does a a good job and produces pleasing sound with the small caveat that speech enhancement should only be used when needed.Is this very noticeably better than the sound from the TV itself? Hugely better!","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2020",AG47KMS65QDQRVG4ZG3AJEFMKFHA,True,2,Style: YAS-109BL
RPOHWVOVCDSJ,B07T5GGR8L,3.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not great soundbar,R. Johnson,3,"I did a lot of research on soundbars when I moved into an apartment and needed a compact yet great sounding system. I was hoping a soundbar would be the solution. I was very disappointed with virtually every soundbar I saw reviewed but thought that this Yamaha would be a moderately priced solution that sounded great. What I found is I have a decent soundbar that frankly doesn't sound better than my initial purchase of a low-cost soundbar at 25% of the cost. The system was not easy to set up, had to call support as the instructions that came with did not match what I was told on the phone and found online. The sound is decent, but not impressive at all unless you crank it up to a level I can't do in an apartment building. If you are directly in front of the bar, it sounds better, but even in my very small living room, I find if you are at the side you really loose the bass and treble highlights (can't fill the room). And after having only 3 weeks I already had it lose its configuration that took quite some time to set up and had to start over to re-set-up. I can't say it is horrible, but really wish I had never purchased it and could use the money I invested in a better solution (if I can find it).","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2019",AEVIKJVCZPTA4ZGQ2WOVZRTAX47A,True,34,Style: YAS-109BL
