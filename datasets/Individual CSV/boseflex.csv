R2TB41OYEQ665X,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply great.,Jake,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my entire ownership of this speaker.Time of writing this review is roughly 8 months after purchase, having used this speaker practically every single day since. This was a replacement for a very well-loved but somewhat lacking B&O (P3?) oval-shaped speaker that inspired of few of my must-have features.My key requirements in purchasing a speaker at this price point were:- Punchy, solid bass, with high accuracy, clear playback throughout most of the volume range- Relatively attractive, understated, simple design with ergonomic and intuitive controls- Easily oriented for high quality playback in a variety of different situations (facing sideways, upwards, at angles)- Long-lasting battery without any obnoxious constant playback interruptions informing you of battery life remainingThis speaker delivers on all of these.The bass is incredibly clear, with no horrible warbling and distortion that‚Äôs very common with dozens of other similar speakers. The audio playback is very crisp and clear, with no noticeable quality losses. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs more than adequate for 95%+ of people. Even at low volumes, the quality is still extremely high. There is a usable, enjoyable sound at every volume level.The design is simple, but handsome. It does not look obnoxious or out of place anywhere. It is just the right size, not too large to pop into a bag, and not too small as to have low-power drivers with poor sound. Very easy to transport. The squared design makes it very stable on most surfaces, but is still rounded enough not to get caught on things. The controls are very easy to understand, even the multi-device Bluetooth cycling and syncing. I have no complaints.The speaker works well for playback in nearly any position, especially when placed on a table or other nice playback surface. It can be placed facing upward, and the speaker enhances playback for all-around sound. When placed horizontally, the same happens for directional playback. Very impressive stability in a wide variety of situations. Some would consider the lack of a lanyard or string to be a downside for this point, but there is massive benefits to keeping this speaker on a surface.The battery life is incredible. Vastly longer than I had really expected for this speaker. With my personal usage (middle volume range, 2-3 uses a day for 30 to 60 minutes at a time), I usually recharge every 1-2 weeks. Not sure what exactly that equates to in real playback time, but I still find it impressive. The speaker will notify you at 20% and 10% battery level, which is exactly what I wanted. Many other speakers will interrupt playback at 75%, 50%, etc. I‚Äôve not experienced any noticeable battery decay during my ownership, but I have only fully depleted and nearly fully recharged the entire time, with no ‚Äúfilling up‚Äù in between.Downsides do exist, but most are inconsequential for me.- The audible indicators that inform you of which device you are connected to can sometimes feel a bit sluggish, especially with long device names.- I feel the price point is still a bit on the high side for the value, but I feel I‚Äôve more than gotten my money‚Äôs worth. I just like a good deal.- Volume occasionally spikes very high in certain scenarios when switching between devices, but is fairly easily turned down after a quick scare.I would highly recommend this speaker to anyone in the market for a speaker at this price point. This is an especially good deal on sale. If you‚Äôre still reading at this point, just get the damn thing on the way.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AHZBIFMKWWZHILYEIYOSP4AIA37Q,TRUE,230,Color: Black
R2Y3WBHYS3U0M4,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars A premium speaker in a sturdy package.,Reviewer MHM 3-5,5,"I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard. I had no expectations of it being a ‚Äúparty‚Äù speaker or anything of the like.But my goodness. This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim. They say it‚Äôs good for less than 10 people. Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there‚Äôs even some punch of the bass. It‚Äôs so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. üòÇSo (for now), I‚Äôm obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don‚Äôt want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It‚Äôs made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn‚Äôt have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to‚Ä¶2. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it‚Äôs on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They‚Äôre not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you‚Äôll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The ‚ÄúUsed‚Äù unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone‚Äôs trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled ‚ÄúRefurbished‚Äù. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn‚Äôt miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I‚Äôd like y‚Äôall to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you‚Äôre blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn‚Äôt want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don‚Äôt expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AH5F7QHDE5VKRAMBN43A5WPU4ADQ,TRUE,104,Color: Black

The sound quality is impressively good, which was a wonderful surprise. You can position it on its side for directional sound or lay it flat for excellent, all-around audio clarity. Its size is perfect for placing on a desk, counter, or even packing in your luggage. The audio is clear and crisp, and it's waterproof, making it ideal for use in the shower. Charging is straightforward with a USB-C connection, just like most of my other devices. The buttons are soft yet durable.

R3N5UYTNS8D2V6,B099TJGJ91,"4.0 out of 5 stars Small speaker, big sound, travel friendly",jonathan lopez,4,"Got this lil thing for Prime Day for only $99. I‚Äôm not going to lie, I had low expectations and planned on returning it. After opening it and setting it up, I got to see what the hype was about. Took me a couple hours of listening to figure out if it was a bang for my buck or a waste of money.I currently have the first UE Megaboom that I use daily that I bought back in 2016. It‚Äôs loud, has bass and can fill a room. Sadly, the charge isn‚Äôt exactly reliable so I was looking for something new. The Bose Link Flex definitely has a great quality sound. It will definitely fill a room. I like to use mine in the shower and acoustically in the shower the bass just sounds amazing!! Speaker actually fell off the shelf from the bass and survived the fall.Now, I listen to just about every genre of music. I found it to sound best with Latin music. Vocals are super clear. When it came to rap music (or music with lots of bass) I found it to sound perfectly balanced when the volume was at about 75%. Above that you‚Äôll definitely still get volume but the bass will take a seat back. I‚Äôm used to the UE Megaboom that has 360 sound. While the Bose Link Flex will fill a room, the sound seems more straight forward depending if you want to stand it up or lay it down.Bose App is decent. Doesn‚Äôt really have any equalizer setting on there if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre loooking for.I got this because it is small enough to pack in a carry on and not take up too much space in my bag. Might I add, it‚Äôs almost the same size as my iPhone 14 Pro Max . I can easily carry both in one hand. Easy to say, I‚Äôm going to keep this speaker with me. Now let‚Äôs see if the battery life is legit. I‚Äôll check back in.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AF35A3ETTRWH62AWEWFQ2GO27VJA,TRUE,14,Color: Green

R3TVEXDLBORXWI,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars 5 Million Stars!! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,Caitriona Gillespie,5,"OMG this is the best speaker which is not a huge floor speaker (over 1 foot high) that is part of a massive speaker system. The sound quality is truly impressive for a speaker of any size, & I think that if I bought another one, which I'm seriously considering, it would rival my Kenwood stereo system, which has two floor speakers that are over a foot high each, & the Kenwood amplifier, & the Kenwood 5-CD player. All that stuff is so big that it needs its own cabinet & takes up several feet of floor space. I don't know how the geniuses at Bose have done it, but they have somehow packed all that sound into a speaker less than half the size of a loaf of bread that is also a very appealing shade of lilac that goes with my d√©cor. The Bluetooth connection works perfectly every time, even though I don't have the newest phone out there. I'm so in love with this speaker, the only complaint I have is purely aesthetic & easily fixed- the fabric loop attached to this beautiful lilac speaker is, for some unknown reason, an entirely ridiculous shade of brilliant orange, which clashes hideously with everything. I solved this problem with a dark purple Sharpie marker. That is the only complaint I have. While this speaker comes without any instructions on how to set it up, the set up is so easy, even when you're not a technology person, that I set it up myself with no help in under a minute. I plugged it in, turned it on, turned the volume all the way up- for some idiotic reason, it comes with the volume all the way down- & then turned on the Bluetooth on my phone & had it search for Bluetooth devices. My phone found the speaker very quickly, paired with it without issue, & started playing. One important thing to know is that when you leave the range of the speaker for an extended period of time, like when I leave for work & take my phone with me, the speaker will turn that connection off, so that when I get home & want to use my speaker again, I need to go over to the speaker with my phone & push the power button once. The speaker will say how much battery power is left & that it is now connected to my phone- I don't turn the Bluetooth off on my phone when I leave the house. I recommend turning the speaker all the way up & then controlling the volume through your phone, which is what I do. I think that's the easiest way to do it. One charge of the battery lasts a long time- at least 12 hours, so that part's great as well. Just buy it already, you won't regret it. It'll beat the pants off of all of your other speakers, even if you already have a nice set of Bose speakers.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AGKOCRUHY2FG2ZHWTZRUH5JYIFBA,TRUE,19,Color: Chilled Lilac
R2TT1UU35P8I2W,B099TJGJ91,"4.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly loud, no EQ controls, few caveats",Jacob Teeler,4,"Bought this for work (I run a forklift and JBLs just arent loud enough) and was pleasantly surprised by how loud it gets. Sound quality is fantastic at all volume levels, its durable and holds up pretty well to the elements. The battery does genuinely last a full 8-10 hour shift playing constantly. A few things to note however.There are no EQ controls for it. Sound is well balanced but theres no bass boost, treble, no nada built in.The app is unnecessary once you get it set up with your device, really only need it to check the battery. The speaker will tell you what its battery percentage is if you turn it off and on though.Max volume is entirely dependent on the device its paired to. If i pair it to my PC, max volume is pretty quiet. If i pair it to my buddy's phone it gets pretty loud, but nowhere near as loud as it is paired to my phone.Volume controls are independent from the device and speaker. You can turn your speaker volume to max but your device is the primary control. So if you have the speaker on low volume and your phone all the way to the max, it wont be as loud as both at max, and vice versa. Its very odd.It does not remember the bluetooth volume of the device its paired to, so if you turn it off and use it the next day, it has a habit of being at full blown volume by default. Just be mindful.Other than that, its excellent and no one will be disappointed by it.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AHEGWVGORT2NYKVPVFMFBFDUYI7Q,TRUE,2,Color: Black

So it‚Äôs not surprising that they pack a lot of quality into this little speaker. For one thing, holds a charge a long time! And it announces each time it‚Äôs turned on how much charge is left. No guessing. The sound quality is really decent for the size of the speaker. It can get very, very loud, if that‚Äôs your thing. It has a bass booster that I usually leave on. I appreciate that it is water resistant as I take this into the bathroom, the kitchen, camping, etc. It paired readily with my iPhone. There are some other features I haven‚Äôt played with yet, like doing my Teams meetings with it using the onboard mic, but I suspect it will be fine.

The unit misleads you by saying you need to download the app 'Bose connect'. I tried to, but could not get it to download from the App store or from the Bose website. Other Bluetooth speakers connected automatically for me, so this was a hassle. I tried to chat with the Bose help bot, but it was of no help; the lady on the phone at Bose tech support was of no help and disconnected mid-sentence and didn't call me back. I tried to return the item on Amazon, then saw a troubleshooting video. Open your 'systems settings' on your computer and select 'sound'; click the Bose option for speaker 'output'.

RMUYYKJ5WTA8Q,B099TJGJ91,4.0 out of 5 stars The sound is awesome but...,HB,4,"It's a Bose so I expected high quality audio and the speaker does that. It's compact and that's part of the issue. It tips over very easily as the base is rather narrow. Second, the battery life leaves a bit to be desired. It's not as long as other speakers I have had but it's decent. I wish the bright white/blue lights were red or could be turned off. It gives off just enough light to be bothersome if you truly need a dark room to sleep. Forget using the app, all it does is connect and you don't really need it to even do that. It wouldn't control anything on this speaker. Lastly, why is it talking? I don't need it to tell me the battery level or that my device is disconnected. I don't need it to speak at all. It's rather annoying bc if you disconnect and don't turn it off, it promptly reminds you. Spooked the hell out of me several times. It gets 4 stars bc audio wise it's absolutely on point as expected. It's the little details that are missing that list a star. Would I buy again? With improvements yes, as is I'd have to think about it.","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2024",AGRPNG4CNHIH5CUK2WGOP4EVFYJA,TRUE,3,Color: Stone Blue

R36YHGL95K3QBJ,B099TJGJ91,3.0 out of 5 stars there‚Äôs a time and place for it!,Steven Jerome Staten II,3,"I purchased this because water broke my old Bose Revolve+. I don‚Äôt consider myself an audiophile, but I do listen to music religiously ‚Äî 100k+ hours annually ‚Äî and I can appreciate a crisp sounding speaker with nuance. This speaker lacks the nuance. It‚Äôs not terribly loud in my opinion, even on full volume in my small apartment. However, it is durable, and I love that it‚Äôs waterproof. Upon further research, I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money ‚Äî many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand, as these speakers can be made for less than $50 and sold for $400+. Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex (product listed here) as well, in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment.After doing some research, I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well. I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use, and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling, as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant. I purchased this on Prime Day for $99 before tax. I would NOT say it‚Äôs worth $150 full price. The battery is not great. I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over. Mediocre in performance overall.It‚Äôs worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon, the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose ‚ÄúRETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS.‚Äù I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers.

Great and very clean sound clarity even when the volume is maxed out. Easy to use and I like the option of being able to connect two different devices onto this speaker. The party mode feature of being able to connect to another Bose Soundlink speaker is something I might try sooner than later as having an extra speaker in the garage would be nice.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AEKQGWZA7OIWWLYAOA3MGKLA5XEQ,TRUE,1,Color: White Smoke

R29T6Q73DL97GO,B099TJGJ91,4.0 out of 5 stars Less sturdy than the SoundLink mini II,Laura Lynn,4,"I'm not sure why but the engineers gave this little speaker feet instead of a sturdy base. I'm a klutz and I expect I'll knock this over or to the ground at any point. Does not seem sturdy in that capacity. Otherwise it's a thick and dense little speaker.Functions as it's supposed to. Charged well when I got it. I can hear it from the other room when I walk away and it's got a nice clear quality to the speaker so far. The charging cord that came with it was quite short but functional. The speaker and instructions are insistent about downloading a useless connection application. Seems like another way to advertise more speakers or to sell user data. It was irritating enough, I almost rated this less because of it.Speaker will not connect to my phone via Bluetooth unless I allow the speaker access to contact information. What a dubious and unwanted feature. Also almost rated less than 4 stars for this.We will see about the value for the money over time.
