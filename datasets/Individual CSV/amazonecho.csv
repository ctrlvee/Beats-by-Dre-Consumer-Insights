ROREMTZJIG72A,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Quantum Leap in Quality,Amazon Customer,5,"The Echo Studio is a quantum leap from any other speaker that Amazon has produced to date. Everything else sounds like a transistor radio in comparison. The sound separation is fantastic and you can actually feel the bass at higher volume levels.There a couple of issues, however. The vaunted 3D sound is a waste on anything other than the songs that are specifically set up for it. DO NOT use it as a default setting. The music that is not 3D will sound muddy and the vocals will be lost in the mix. However, if you turn it off, the music will immediately brighten and the vocals will be clear and crisp. There are a lot of online reviews where they claim that the clarity of the vocals is lacking. That is because they were early reviews and took place before you could turn off the Spatial enhancement option. Second, if you combine the speaker in a group or as stereo pair, playing the amazon music app causes songs to stop playing at random and skip to the next song. I have read online where it stops playing altogether for some people. It does not happen when just playing though a single speaker. I have not experienced the problem, as yet, when playing through the alexa app. However the Alexa app navigation leaves something to be desired. Also the Alexa app doesn’t show the quality of the track that’s playing.Ok, issues out of the way, I have 2 of the Echo Studio paired for stereo and the sound is a revelation. Listening to the White Album in Ultra HD reveals melodies and instrumentation that I’ve never heard before. The clarity of the voices is amazing. It’s like listening to it for the first time. The 3D tracks sound great as well. There is a massive sound stage. The music really does envelop you. It’s not the same as surround sound. So those looking to relive the days of 5.1 SACD and DVD-HD will be disappointed. It’s impossible to get the same effect from one or two speakers. You won’t hear discrete sounds from behind you, but instead you get a full range from in front of you. It’s difference between sitting the front row for a concert (Echo Studio) and sitting on stage in the middle of the orchestra (5.1 surround). I haven’t tried out the pair for fireTV as yet. The current options for Dolby Atmos are limited and I’ve already watched the new season of Jack Ryan, but I may try this at some point in the future.The amazon credit for turning in an old Echo, sealed the deal on getting the second Studio. The wait for a second one was too long from Amazon, so I got it at Best Buy. They also participate in the Echo buy back program. So, I turned in an old echo dot and got 25% off the new studio (the discount is the same regardless of which echo you turn in), along with a $5 credit. So instead of $219 (with tax), I got the second studio for $155 (with tax). Great deal and with the discount it’s about the same price as an Echo Plus.The size may be an issue to some, but it wasn’t with me. In order to accommodate 5 speakers, there is no way for it fit into the same space as the Plus. The space is really need to fit the subwoofer and it certainly makes a difference.So my final thoughts: It’s a fantastic speaker. Much better than anything else you can get from Amazon. The price is right, especially if you turn in old echo dot (any echo really, but the dot is the cheapest of the bunch and you get the same discount). Don’t use the Stereo Spatial Enhancement. The songs in 3D will play that way regardless of the setting and it makes everything else sound worse (in my opinion). There may be point when Amazon releases an update to fix this, but at this point it’s worthless. I have never had a Bose or a Sonos, so I can’t compare, but I doubt anything in this price range can compete with what the Studio has to offer. If sound quality is important to you and you subscribe the Amazon HD music service (the studio is the only device Amazon offers that can play the Ultra HD music in full 24/196 quality), I would say run don’t walk to get one (or two) of these. You won’t regret it.UPDATE: I did try out the Dolby Atmos feature last night. I watched some of Jack Ryan and Carnival Row. The effect was just as outstanding as the music. Wide sound stage and clear, crisp dialogue. I do think that for watching movies the subwoofer might be a good addition. The bass was definitely present, but I think that the subwoofer would add some welcome bottom to the sound field (Perhaps that will be a Black Friday/Christmas purchase). The setup was fairly simple after restarting the 4K firestick. Initially the firestick was greyed out in the Alexa app, but after a restart it showed up. Set up involved just following the instructions after that.As stated before, there are very few options to watch Dolby atmos enabled content on Amazon. It does not allow it from Netflix, and as of yet, does not have the option for the Disney+. Hopefully that will change at some point in the near future (although I’m not holding my breath). However, since my main reason for buying the Studio in the first place was for music playback, I see the Atmos option as an added bonus.Update 2: they have fixed spatial enhancement mode! It sounds fantastic. If you toggle between the two modes, you can actually hear the sound field shrink. It's now very worthwhile. Also I added a sub to the mix and it does wonders for the sound. If you are using the studio in the kitchen or a home office, one will work spectacularly. If you are using it in a living room or large space then 2 with a sub is the way to go. The sub adds so much depth when you are listening in a larger space. Currently playing through the app is a problem but voice commands still work fine.","Reviewed in the United States November 19, 2019",AGV3Y7AA7N2IEGE4QIZB74GLEFQA,True,279,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R3IMWWB3T99A7F,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars These must be paired in stereo!,Steve Pugliese,5,"There will be plenty of reviews for the Studio in stand alone, single speaker use. It does sound excellent that way. But if you pair two Studios and throw in the Echo Sub, that is an extraordinary composition! That is the way to do the Echo Studio! That is how I'll review it here.I decided I must pair two Studios since I had two Echo Plus's stereo paired with an Echo Sub and it sounded pretty darn good. So I had to try the Studio paired in stereo, and since I had the Sub, I threw that in too. What else am I going to do with it? The Sub added a lot to the two Plus's. I wondered would you even notice it with the two Studios? I'm here to say that you definitely notice it. You notice it's not there, I can tell you.The sound of this whole system (two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) is quite exceptional. I would have to say it's thrilling! Yes, it costs $530 but that is bound to come down and did I tell you that it sounds incredible? It commands a respect, it really does. There is such a depth to this. The bass is deliberate and authoritative. Very punchy. It has exceptional dynamic range (at high volumes this can be startling) and the stereo image is just stunning. An enormous stage. Those 6 midrange speakers sound sweet indeed. Be sure to turn everything up in the equalizer in Audio Settings of the device in the Alexa App. This thing likes loud! It can easily handle max volume for extensive listening.You crank this up to ten and it literally takes over the room. If you can listen at that volume for awhile with this system (you must live without neighbors) you will be found with a huge smile on your face.All of Amazon's music library is now available in lossless CD quality streaming or better, which shines on this. The new celebrated 3D formats also sound excellent, though I thought there'd be more to them (Abbey Road sounded great but I didn't think it was transformed). But anything you play on this will sound exceptional. I really can't believe Amazon has taken it this far from the original Echo. Bravo! I notice that the Apple Homepod is now down to $200 at Best Buy. Would two of them paired sound better than this setup? I truly doubt it. They'd need a subwoofer and none, as far as I know, are available for it.A few things. The circling Alexa lights are now on top of the speaker. You can no longer really see them from the side, which is unfortunate. I love those lights! And two, the Studio comes with this ""spatial"" setting set. I recommend turning it off. In the Alexa app, go to the device and then Audio Settings and below the equalizer is that on off button for the spatial effect. I don't find it adds anything even though it really changes the acoustics. But if you want to hear music as it was recorded, leave this off.Oh, and I have to say that Amazon still does not make it super easy to set this all up. You have to start with a new or deregistered speaker. Set up each separately and then pair them. But it's anything but obvious or close to foolproof. Come on, Amazon!And I feel I must tell you that you can't connect to the Studio by Bluetooth when stereo paired. It will only play through one Studio, the first one you set up. To use the Studios in stereo pair with the Echo Sub, you can only stream. And you can only stream if you pay.Finally, then, these things are big. Really quite large. And seemingly only available now in black, though there's a gray one in Amazon's web site ads. This is not a speaker that sits demurely upon a table. It's almost as big as the Echo Sub, if that helps visualize it. But you will definitely be challenged as to its home, because that is where this will stay, like forever. Especially if you go for the whole magilla. But I urge you to at least try it (the whole magilla!). But be prepared, I guarantee you won't send them back!UPDATE: After a software update, the Spatial effect is now the preferred way, so leave it on. Turning it off now makes the music too flat. I think it may even turn off one of the mid range speakers. But something's missing!ADDENDUM:After two years, these still shine as brightly as ever. But the thing that must be emphasized is that this system of two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub is designed to take full advantage of Amazon Music’s HD streaming service, since these can work together only with streamed audio. Using that enables you to get at least CD quality audio recorded in lossless FLAC files (what Amazon calls HD, 16-bit/44.1kHz) for everything in the catalog, and Ultra HD (up to 24-bit/192kHz) available on an ever-growing list of recordings. In addition, it is also capable of playing Amazon’s (admittedly still in limited quantity) so called 3D Audio recordings (Amazon Music supports Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Reality Audio spatial audio formats). If you don’t get the Amazon Music HD package ($12.99 monthly with Prime / $14.99 without), then you will be missing out on what these speakers are designed to deliver. Amazon’s Ultra HD music must be heard on a system that supports it to be appreciated. It truly is something else in audio quality, significantly better sounding than any CD or LP. And Amazon Music’s catalog is growing by leaps and bounds every month. It is currently quite vast, even its Classical Music selection which has exploded in the two years since the Echo Studio was introduced.Using the Amazon Echo Link ($140), you could get this same quality streaming audio (or even better depending on your amp and speakers) for an existing Hi-Fi setup (at least I think you can- there seems to be some confusion about whether it supports the full 24-bit/192kHz Ultra HD), although you could not get 3D Audio with the Link. You could also use the Echo Link to attach any other sub-woofer to your Echo Studio pair but that would also require an additional amplifier thrown in. However, if you don’t have that Hi-Fi system already, these (2 paired Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) are the way to go to take full advantage of Amazon Music HD at a very favorable price. Just compare their cost to that of a good Hi-Fi system consisting of amplifier, pre-amp, two speakers and a sub-woofer as well as the Echo Link you’d need. The Echo speakers here are a definite bargain for getting excellent audio with minimal wires or fuss!","Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2019",AFO4QU7DSPYI65HOW4WNG667TPYA,True,2116,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R3B7CJ425Z8UZM,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Smart Speaker,jarreeddd,5,"Amazon really came through with this product. A few things to take into consideration:Sound Quality:While the sound quality is extremely good, especially given the price range, it’s definitely not on the top of the audiophile list. That being said, for the average person, this is a great speaker. It lacks luster in the mids so lyrics themselves aren’t as crisp as other high fidelity speakers on the market. However, the bass is awesome. No distortion. Also, this thing gets LOUD. Great for a house party or if you feel like rocking out.Alexa:While this may not be the BEST speaker out there, the Alexa integration and capability is great. The mics will pick up your voice from across the room even with music blasting. If you’re a heavy Alexa user then the great sound quality and seamless Alexa integration makes this the speaker for you. I personally run all my smart home devices through Alexa so having one more assistant in the room is great.Size:This speaker is chubby. Kind of looks like a chopped off robot head. It will definitely not just blend in the background. I have it on the corner of my desk 60x30 and still have plenty of room multiple screens and peripherals.Room adaptation:This speaker will definitely fool the room with sound. As far as the “3D Sound goes”, it’s really going to depend on the placement and structure of the room. If you place this in the corner of a room and try to listen to it from the opposite corner, you do loose some of that full sound effect. Also, the size and material of your room are going to effect the acoustics and how the sound bounces off the walls. It seems you really only get that full 3D sound effect if it’s directly in front of you and you have 4 solid walls for the sound to bounce off of. I have mine on the corner of the desk with the front speaker facing me. When I’m sitting at my desk I really get the full 3D effect. To manually reset/calibrate to a room hold down the command button for about 15 seconds.3D MUSIC:This speaker performs optimally when playing 3D Music from Amazon. Something to keep in mind though is that there are only about 1,000+ 3D song a offered. Who knows what the future has in store but that shouldn’t be the selling point if you’re looking at this speaker. Either way, you’re still getting great sound from any music app.Built in Zigbee:I don’t use any zigbee devices so I can’t comment on this. I also couldn’t figure out how it really works.Competition:For the same prize you could purchase a smaller Sonos One. Which one has better sound quality is up for debate but what’s lacking in the Sonos is Bluetooth connectivity. Also, the built in Alexa is limited.Using it as a sound bar:I personally only use this for listening to music while I’m at my desk. I can’t really see this being better than a a bar and subwoofer around the same price range or even slightly more expensive. I think it would work great with two Studio’s but then again ... there might be better options at that price range. User preference.Summary:I truly am impressed with this speaker and really enjoy using it. If you’re a casual music listener Like me and currently or plan to utilize Alexa, this is a great speaker. If you really want to fill the room then I would consider buying two and strategically placing them somewhere in the desired room.","Reviewed in the United States July 6, 2020",AH2KSTCMUKZIS5OUL5V66X3MRUTQ,True,27,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R3ICPDHKJYUHPV,B07G9Y3ZMC,"4.0 out of 5 stars A sweet-sounding, self-contained hi-fi smart speaker system that will both delight and frustrate you",Cam,4,"TL;DR for the Echo Studio is that the speaker, whether paired with the Echo Sub or not, running hi-fi music (I’m on Amazon HD) sounds fantastic, but there are so many glitches with it that I’m hard pressed to give it a full recommendation.I love music, but don’t consider myself an audiophile. I’m a family man and don’t have the luxury of a dedicated “listening room,” and I’m certainly not going to spend thousands on a home sound system. I like listening to music while having my morning tea, relaxing in my bedroom, and when in my car. I have so far been using a pair of Sony XB-43 bluetooth speakers at home and they have been adequate.I decided to look at upgrade options when I went over to Amazon HD for my streaming service (I also tried Tidal, but that’s for another review). I wanted something convenient, plug & play, and as a parent, relatively childproof. Bluetooth was not an option, as one loses most of the hi-fi benefits over bluetooth. Enter the Echo Studio. I already have a few Echo Dots, Fire TV, and as mentioned, Amazon HD Music, so it seemed like a natural fit. It should be noted however, that although Alexa Cast only works with Amazon Music, you can stream music with the other major services, Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and others.So I bought an Echo Studio for the breakfast area where I have my tea, and where I had previously been moving a bluetooth speaker every morning. Setup was quick and painless and I was immediately impressed with the sound. It’s not a high-end home stereo system, but it’s the best single-unit speaker system I have ever had and heard. And it’s $200.I used the Alexa app to set the EQ, but you can simply tell Alexa to “increase bass” or “reduce treble” or make any other adjustments on the fly, mid-song or whenever you like. I see some reviewers complaining about the sound profile and wonder if they made EQ adjustments for their personal preferences or to suit the type of music being played.Impressed, I ordered a second Studio and an Echo Sub for my bedroom. Setup and pairing the Sub was equally simple. At first I thought the Sub was defective, or not set up correctly, because I could barely hear anything coming from it. Turns out that for me anyway, it needs to be at a certain volume and playing certain music for it to really be felt. But feel it you will, as the Sub makes the music fill the room in a way that the Studio by itself doesn’t. Make sure you put the Sub on the floor.The glitches started here, with the bedroom Studio. The music would randomly stop playing, whether during a playlist or simply when I had asked it to play music from a certain artist or genre. When I say that, I mean every single time I used it. Two or three songs and then nothing. Extremely frustrating. My wifi setup is solid, so I looked at suggestions online, and several people recommended putting your Studio on your 5GHz and cordoning it off there (everything else in the house on your 2.4GHz). I tried this, but it did not solve the problem (I ended up leaving the Studios on 2.4GHz and it has been the best option). I unplugged and went through setup on the Studio again and the problem, for the most part, seemed resolved. I took the opportunity to bump my internet tier up to improve my overall household speeds. The music on both my Studios will still stop playing occasionally though, for no apparent reason, with a strong internet connection. And they will go into “red ring” mode too, which is extremely frustrating.Fast forward to now. Sound quality is noticeably better than my bluetooth speakers, and I mean noticeably. I am hearing guitar strings and cymbal crashes on music that I don’t remember ever hearing before. I used my bluetooth speaker last night for a bit and it was painful. There is no way I can ever go back to standard definition music streaming and bluetooth speakers. Think SD television versus HD television.Now for the drawbacks. These things are glitchy. Music will stop playing for no reason. Voice recognition of the music or the playlist you asked for is hit and miss. The Studio itself will go into “Sorry, I’m having trouble right now” mode (red ring mode) and won’t play any music for you. At all. For five minutes or for an hour. I have to remind myself that it is a somewhat data-intensive streaming service and think back to the earlier days of Netflix and the like.Also, while it is convenient to just tell Alexa what you want to listen to, at times I miss having the control of just playing music from my phone, and the Alexa casting is frustrating. Bring up the Amazon Music app, start playing your music (which you have to do before you get the casting button), wait for it to connect, then finally get the music going. Yes, it's probably only seven seconds, but trust me, it feels cumbersome. Again, even Netflix needs to load up.If you happen to use a voice command directly to the Studio while casting (because when casting, you lose the Alexa voice control function from your Amazon Music app) it reverts back to Alexa app control and you’re out of casting mode (and phone control). Even if you don’t, the casting drops after a bit and you have to go through the connection process again. I’m not going to pair the Studio over bluetooth to get phone control, if I wanted bluetooth quality sound I wouldn’t have bought the Studio. (I did pair it once to check it out, and the music was at a super low volume).It would be nice to be able to browse the music app and tap a song or playlist at any time and just have it play on the Studio as with a bluetooth connection. As it is, I have to tell Alexa to play it while I’m looking at music choices on the app and hope she gets it right. While on the Alexa app and controlling from there, sometimes it will show me the playlist I’m listening to, sometimes it doesn’t.I also have Apple Music, as other family members are on Apple Music, and other than one time at the outset, it will play the Apple Music when requested without any problems (Amazon Music is my default setting).As I sit writing this review, my Studio has played my music flawlessly the entire time and sounds fantastic, and this is what keeps me in the Echo Studio game and considering a third Studio to stereo pair in the bedroom with the Echo Sub (Prime Days?). If it performed this way consistently and the Alexa and Amazon Music apps integrated more smoothly, I would give the Echo Studio a 100% recommendation. I am holding out hope that future software updates will smooth out the rough edges. Until then, know what you’re getting. A sweet-sounding, self-contained hi-fi smart speaker system that will both delight and frustrate you.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2021",AGZKEU6775IB7BPUFQXEQ32UPSUA,True,464,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R2UDHP4SHVFE9T,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Solid Performance in a Unique Product,Clinton W. Salvato,5,"I had been looking at, and watching reviews of the Echo Studio since it was announced last year, and had decided, it was a product, that I initially wanted to get my hands on, and at least test.Since I have been happy with my Echo Plus 2nd Gen, and Echo Dot 3rd Gen, I put the studio on the back burner.Earlier this month, I just happened to be at my local Best Buy, and they had a couple in stock, so I decided to grab one.First Impressions:The studio looks and feels to be well builtIt seems to be able to fit into a good amount of places, although I've only had it in one so far, but (judging by that location) leads me to believe, even though the largest echo speaker, that it can fit anywhere (within reason).The sound is extremely well balanced, at least for the majority of music I listen to, and even a good stereo mix is immersive on this speaker, the left and right channels come out clear, and it's NOT just stereo, it does immerse you, however, I have noticed that it depends on the style and recording quality of the music as to how well that works. As others have mentioned in reviews, by default the Echo Studio has a Spacial feature enabled to enhance stereo. I'll leave this up to YOU to turn it off, or leave it on. I will leave this suggestion, if you don't have a technical background in audio, and want to keep things simple turn this off in the Alexa app under settings:device settings: your echo studio:audio settings. I say this because it's essentially what Dolby Pro Logic, and other similar technologies do to simulate surround sound from stereo. Some music it actually helps and gives a nice affect to, and others it distorts, and actually makes sound worse. Putting that aside though Audio sounds really good through this device, and the bottom line is, to get the best performance, you can't always use the defaults, or someone else's settings, because there are too many variables. that can change.Other things I've found to share, Initially I had WiFi issues with the 5ghz channel, because the Echo doesn't get full signal where it's at here, but switching to the 2.4ghz channel has made things more stable, not just for the echo studio, but features like multi room music, and overall performance. My advice here is:Yes, 2.4ghz is going to be a slower channel then the 5Ghz one in many cases. However, for an audio only device such as an echo without a screen, it's not going t make a difference in performance. So if issues with Wifi, and it's on the 5ghz channel, try setting it to 2.4. Amazon even recommends this, in their help article on updating and troubleshooting Wifi settings with echo products. Let me rephrase that, they suggest 5ghz for faster performance but suggest 2.4 for better stability and signal range.Bottom Line:The echo studio is a great smart speaker with a unique design and purpose. As always, while the sound is great from this device, it's not a replacement for a dedicated surround system. If you're ok with this fact, and still want to try this product, I recommend it 100%.","Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2020",AHFCEVZCWVGXS6AMGVQCAM7I7NBQ,True,16,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R1HM75FHMPH5NT,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Two Echo Studios in stereo mode sounds exponentially better than one,REM52,5,"(Note: This was written by me and posted elsewhere, so ignore the personal references – I have simply pasted it here so that I didn’t have to write it again!) Two regular Echo speakers paired in stereo mode don't even come close to the ear-pleasing sound that comes from two Echo Studios in stereo mode. As you said, Ty, you listened to only one Studio speaker, and some of that listening was in a surround mode. The Echo Studio does not ""shine"" with just one Studio (when playing regular stereo music files, which are the most common). Two of them paired in stereo mode sound exponentially better. I humbly ask you to reconsider your 7 rating for sound quality and change it to 9 or 10, for the benefit of potential buyers interested in purchasing high quality equipment. If using two Echo Studios in stereo mode, turn off the ""Upmixing"" toggle switch in the Alexa app. Upmixing tries to adapt 2-channel stereo music to the 3D potential of the Studio. If you don't turn off upmixing, the sound will not be that clear and direct, and you will get the wrong impression about how good these speakers really are. That is why some reviewers gave the Echo Studio a low rating when it first came out because you could not turn off the “upmixing” (Stereo Spatial Enhancement) feature, but now you can. With that feature turned on, the speaker will try to add some processing to the sound and that doesn't sound very good in stereo mode with two Studios. That processing may sound ok with one Studio, but even then it's hit-and-miss, depending on which song is playing. Up-mixing is not perfect and not best for all songs.Comparison of the Echo Studio to the Regular Echo:The regular $99 Echo has drivers (internal speaker units) whose sound gets somewhat trapped inside the enclosure case, as the separate woofer and tweeter drivers face each other with a small space between them (they point down and up, not out -- one pointing at the other!) instead of facing outwardly like the Echo Studio’s drivers. But the 3 midrange drivers and one tweeter inside each Echo Studio are facing outward and project the sound outside of the enclosure. That makes a big difference -- there's much more clarity and presence in the midrange and treble. It does not get muffled or trapped inside the enclosure at all; it is allowed to come out clearly and completely. I am hearing detail in songs I’ve been playing for decades -- details I’ve never heard before. Those details are clear as can be without being harsh or grating to the ears. The outward facing circular arrangement of the midrange and tweeter array act like sort of a wide-dispersion tweeter – no matter where you are standing you hear each speaker channel’s sound very clearly (ideal for when you are moving around, working in the kitchen, etc. And I am talking about stereo mode here, not a surround mode). The bass is clear and mostly tight – just right without overdoing it. And if you listen to talk radio on these, the sound (EQ) automatically adjusts itself so that the talker's voice doesn’t sound boomy (those built-in monitoring microphones work well).Finally, it is recommended to adjust the EQ settings using the Alexa app, and set the EQ to: Bass middle (5 on the scale), Midrange boosted to about 6 or 7 out of 10, and Treble to about 8 out of 10 (this sounds best in the very small alcove that I have these speakers set up in). Use a good-sounding music file for test listening – an audio file that has never been compressed more than once, and has been encoded well, and been recorded in high quality (not necessarily a hi-res file). An excellent sounding sample to buy and use for testing purposes is Rudolf from Burl Ives’ album “Have a Holly Jolly Christmas”. Sure, it’s an old-fashioned song but it is extremely well-recorded and encoded (at least on the specific album I mentioned). You can purchase it for 99 cents on Amazon’s online digital music store if you want to have it stored in the cloud and playable on demand -- on these speakers.Note about Setup: if you have a weak Wi-Fi signal, the slow signal from your Wi-Fi router may cause some confusing delays during setup, so if you encounter this, begin by finding a way to get an adequate signal strength to these excellent speakers. Move your router closer or maybe buy a Wi-Fi extender if your Wi-Fi signal is weak in the spot where the two Studios are located. After a minute or so of getting established, they will find their way to sync with each other and play in perfect, flawless stereo without you having to do anything after the setup.

R2R3BT8Q353VJ9,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Better than HomePod and Sonos One,Sucram,5,"UPDATEI’ve had the 2.1 setup connected to a 4K Stick for 5 months, which has been used as a sound bar/stereo in our master bedroom. From a music perspective, it sounds it’s pretty good! The sound stage is full and produces decent bass. I wish it got a little louder. I find the bass response better for music than movies (I LOVE heavy bass in action scenes). If you like heavy bass for action movies, you may be a little disappointed. .I have, but no longer experience the connectivity issues others have written about. Mine were limited to music playback, however the issue subsided a few months ago.I’ll address three improvement areas:1) When connected with the sub, all the lows go through the sub and the woofers on the studios are rendered useless, unless the volume is high. The trade-off is clearer sound than when the studios are paired alone. Personally, I look at it as a design flaw. All three units should produce lows (or at least have the settings in the EQ to do so) for a better, more immersive bass experience. What good is a 5.25’ Studio driver if it won’t be used when paired?? 🤔2) As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a lip syncing issue when used as a home theater. Depending on the source the fire stick is decoding, there can be a noticeable sound lag. I have not discovered a way to address this issue.3) The Studios have the ability to play lossless tracks (24bit). However, paired with a Fire device (Cube, 4K stick... doesn’t matter) the output drops to 16bit, because the sound is decoded in the Fire device and played through the Studio. This simply means that fidelity/musical clarity is lost . The limitation lies within the Fire device, not the Studio. However, it’s worth mentioning because when connected to a Fire device, the Studios will be limited to the capability of the decoding device. If they’re used as a stand-alone stereo for music only, you can use the Studios to their full ability.BOTTOM LINEI like the setup. I already owned the Eco Sub so its cost had no bearing on my buying decision. The Studios were an add-on for me. In fairness, I came out off of pocket $240 for both Studios combined. With that said, FOR ME I find great value and functionality.The question is, if I was to start over and pay full retail ($400 for two Studios + $130 for the sub) for a wireless stereo/sound bar system, what would I think? Could I find a better wireless Atmos Sound bar + woofer with no lip syncing issues for the money? YEP! Could I find a better wireless Smart stereo for the money? I’m not so sure! Could I find one that does both pretty well? I doubt it! Could I split the money between two decent systems, one for music and one for theater? Not why would I go do that??? I’d get one that could do multiple things.FOR THE MONEY it’s good buy. It’s not a Sonos Playbar + Sub (which is 2x the cost) nor a B&W sound bar & Sub (which is 4x the cost). It’s good for the money.If you can look past the intermittent lip sync issue, go for it. If that's a deal breaker, spend more and get a sound bar that also produces good music.————————————————————The speakers sounds great! No complaints; simple setup, quick calibration and I was off to the races.From a price point, it's comparable to the Sonos One. From a sound quality, it far exceeds. Sonos One is probably slightly clearer, but that's where the comparisons stop. Echo Studio has a wider/fuller sound stage, more bass, gets louder. The closest comparison is probably the HomePod or Play 3. IMO, this sounds better than both.I already own an Echo Sub and ordered an additional Studio for pairing. I have yet to connect to FireTV 4k to test the home theater setting.In summary, this produces very good sound, the price is reasonable and it's the best smart speaker on the market... in my humble opinion...","Reviewed in the United States November 20, 2019",AESCZXYRRCQIGJENUJNOCLABQLEQ,True,69,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R23FTPV6XGQSBX,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Multi-Player Music issue solved,CafeSociety,5,"Alexa Echo SpeakersMulti-room Music issuesI found a solution to not being able to get more than one speaker to work at a time, paired, or set up a “Multi-Room Music” in the Alexa app. This solution also fixed my inability to get Apple enabled devices connected into HomeKit, or even Google Nest Hubs to set up, period.Quick answer: Deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation” when activating your 2.4 Wi-Fi broadcast on your router.I also took all speakers off guest wifi. But I’ll try to put them back to see if that is necessary now.Back story: Months of issues with HomeKit, (only weeks with Echo Multi-Room Music), I gave up trying and decided to try Alexa and Google to replace my Apple smart home efforts. I spent way too much time. After the fix, I’ll live a blended tech life. I’ll give a quick answer, followed by my backstory: Last week I was at my wits end in utter frustration over three major roadblocks. I acquiesced and decided to try Alexa because I couldn’t get almost any of my Apple HomeKit enabled devices into HomeKit, except for new Apple products. I knew it had to be something small I was missing. Alexa was sooooo easy and quick to connect to everything, before I figured out the fix. (I dislike the echo show advertising, their echo speakers are better.) While they seemed a breeze to connect everything, for some reason I couldn’t get more than one echo speaker to work at a time. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room Music or even connect a pair to play together. Hundreds of tries. I deleted, reset, rebooted, spent over 4 hours with Comcast yesterday (thankfully a Boston native who did not put me on hold every minute like certain countries) getting my internet working again. I had rebooted my modem and router so many times, my computer got molasses slow and I feared I went too farIn interest I also decided to try a few Google nest hub speakers. Black Friday had great sales on all this stuff. Trying to set up googles hub 7 was impossible. It wouldn’t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before “Something went wrong” message. Probably over 70 tries. (Google is better than Echo Show. Apple HomePod mini sounds crisper and better than Amazon echo 4 and mini 5’s. But Alexa is way friendlier to interact with verbally, and price point, well...)Frustration. Thursday, I broke down and bought my first Apple Homepod Mini to see if I can get that working and see if it works better than the Apple TV 4k Ethernet connection. The HomePod mini gave me a hint how to solve all these l connection and internet blocks. The HomePod mini kept telling me that I don’t have “peer-to-peer connection” allowed on my network.Now, I’m a little techy, but it took three days (ehem, months) to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It’s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast.I had to deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation.”That was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months, ..year.For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this particular router setting, so I thought I’d share with ppl. Tonight, I finally am able to simultaneously play music on all of my Echo speakers, connect my HomeKit enabled and Google nest hubs.I’m not sure what this will do for my/your internet security. But I’m going with it for now. And I’ll try to put all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi. I’ll never really leave Apple, but after interacting with other smart speakers, it’s probably not going to be my main go to for speaker or answers to questions. Or I’ll just get too creeped out by Google and Amazon invasiveness and acquiesce with Apple instead. Echo Dot 5 (this is such a sprite, great speaker!)Echo 4are my favorite for Amazon EchoEcho Studioseems the least smart, most deaf, quiet, combative, difficult to interact with, of the three speakers. Hopefully the Multi-Room music fix will improve my experience with itEcho Show 8Meh. Far too much and annoying advertising of non-solicited or wanted advertisements. Least user friendly screen to work with. It sits unplugged for the most part. I mostly got this for a friend who visits who wants a YouTube fireplace playing on the tv.SIDE NOTE on other Smart Home Amazon (online, or physical store) products, related to this topic:I have been pleased with Smartbot plugs, switches and app, the Levoit 600s air purifiers and app (app goes by VeSync), and Lutron Caséta Light Switches and Dimmers, and hub. Lutron has the most stable and reliable app out there. I was fine running their apps separately. They are very nice, better than the big 3 apps. Well, back to listening to music throughout my house instead of one or two rooms. Joy!","Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2023",AET2S5FABMJZMJRPX2DPLTYNWXDQ,True,18,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R3GJ6M7II6KROT,B07G9Y3ZMC,"5.0 out of 5 stars Really Worthwhile Upgrade from ""Echo 3rd gen Smart Speaker""",Andy San Diego,5,"I've had the ""Echo 3rd gen Smart Speaker"" for 4 years, and am surprised to see it cost $99, close to the $150 I just (July 2024) paid for the subject Echo Studio (refurbished). What a big upgrade! But not to be compared with a big hi fi speaker set-up I used to have, Harman Kardon. In Ravel's Bolero, the big crash at the peak of the crescendo would actually stop my heart. I'm trying that now on the Echo Studio, but I'm sure it won't even break any glass.Adding this edit a few days later. The companion Echo Subwoofer will arrive today. I can't wait to see what it will add. I am optimistic. I note that the Studio delivers that special sound of Italian tenors, one I can stand for only a few minutes at a time. The point I was trying to make in my original review is that the Studio does not give out that brilliant lifelike large cymbal-like deafening crash you get with a true hi fi LP player/tuner/cabinet speakers. But, coupled with Amazon Music, the Studio, hopefully augmented by the Subwoofer, is highly pleasurable. I'll update this after I try the Sub. The performance of Bolero that Alexa came up with is not the performance I had on LP with the big speakers, so that is also a factor.Edit August 5, 2024: First, regarding the Sub, I was not able to get it going even with about an hour on the phone with Amazon Customer Service. I couldn't pair the Sub with the Studio, and had to return it. However, I picked up the tip from another review that Alexa will increase or decrease the Studio's treble and bass. I said twice, ""Alexa, turn up the bass."" And today I asked her to play J.S. Bach. Many of his compositions include solos by viola or cello, and I find the Studio's bass satisfactory. For comparison, I reset the Studio to its original settings (hold the mic button and the volume down button for 20 seconds) and I couldn't hear any difference in the bass. Both settings sound fine.August 8, 2024 To reinforce my favorable opinion. I just listened to the entire Sibelius violin concerto with Hilary Hahn and my morning coffee, no distractions, and enjoyed it so much. My favorite piece so far.Today will try pairing my ""Echo 3rd gen Smart Speaker"" in another part of this room, both about 20 feet from where I sit.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2024",AEPTDB7BAXKDQQOI2QMHCNV6JHBA,True,1,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R3HYR9LHISIGJ8,B07G9Y3ZMC,3.0 out of 5 stars Audio Issues when configured as home theater,Dean,3,"This journey got started when Amazon recently announced their newly upgraded music service, Amazon Music HD.For an audiophile, musician and music lover such as myself, this announcement was the holy grail of music. Amazon claimed you can now access millions of tracks in lossless hi resolution audio quality. But let m clear on what this really means to avoid confusion. Typical streaming services such as Spotify stream with audio quality that is sub-par to audio CD's. Amazon's new service boasts both HD audio and Ultra HD audio. When you pull up a track on the service, it designates whether it is an HD audio track, or an Ultra HD audio track. An HD audio track is CD quality, with a bit rate of 16 bits and a sampling rate from 44.1khz to 48kkhz. While many marketers tout this as lossless, it's not really lossless, but it is a big improvement over standard streaming. On the other hand, true lossless is what Ultra HD audio is all about. True lossless Ultra Audio tracks must have a bit rate of 24 bits, and a sample rate that can go as high as 192k. These are true hi-resolution audio tracks that are much better sounding than HD tracks. I was an early adopter of the now defunct DVD-Audio/SACD formats, which were true 24 bit hi-res audio, so I immediately upgraded to the new Amazon Music HD service, excited to have such a vast library of hi-res audio tracks now at my disposal.I had recently downsized my home, so didn't have the room anymore for a true 5.1 discreet surround system anymore. I'v been using a soundbar and wasn't happy. So when Amazon introduced the Echo Studio, I took notice. After researching, I learned that the Echo Studio supports 24 bit audio, meaning it has the ability to play Ultra HD tracks. So it was time to update my audio system. I went to Best Buy the first day the Studios went on sale there, and invested in 2 Echo Studios and an Echo Sub.In the Alexa app, you can configure these components for a home theater environment and that was my plan. I had also already owned a Fire TV Cube, which was great for streaming my content and controlling my home theater devices using voice commands. I upgraded my Fire TV Cube to gen 2 in anticipation of integrating it with my Echo Studios and Sub.If you want Dolby Atmos soundtracks when watching movies, you need to have the Fire TV/Fire TV Cube in the mix, as the Fire TV performs the audio decoding for these surround modes. Through the Alexa app, it was relatively easy to configure the Fire TV Cube, configure each Echo Studio for left and right channel, and the sub. That is my Home Theater Group.Now this is where things begin to derail. I said to Alexa ""Play Jack Ryan"", and I was immediately impressed with the sound emanating from the 2 Studios and the Sub. It did a great job decoding the Dolby Atmos soundtrack, and short of a true discreet surround setup, I was quite impressed. Center dialog came through nicely, soundtrack effects were presented on a nice wide soundstage, giving a nice surround illusion without actual rear speakers.Next up, the moment I've been waiting for. Time to listen to some 24 bit hi res audio. Through the Amazon Music HD app in the Fire TV Cube, I searched for some Ultra HD tracks. Again the tracks are designated as HD or Ultra HD. I decided to play The Sound of Silence by Disturbed, which was marked as Ultra HD. ""Alexa, play the Sound of Silence by Disturbed"". Oddly, the song started playing, but it took about 5 seconds for the audio to actually kick in, cutting of the beginning of the song. The other thing I noticed was when I used the voice command, it pulled up the standard HD version of the track. I knew there was an Ultra HD version, as I had just looked for it. So I did a manual search, found the Ultra HD version and started playing it. Oddly, it sounded no different from the other version to me. The label on the screen said Ultra HD now, so this was odd. I clicked on the track information, and was surprised to learn that even though the screen label for the track is Ultra HD, the song was actually streaming at 16 bit, 44.1k audio. This is not hi-res Ultra HD at all. Any laymen would look at the screen and think they're streaming in Ultra HD because it says it's an Ultra HD track, but the track information was telling a different story.This is where the call to tech support happened. Tech support sent some logs to the development team and them got back to me. What he tried to tell me at first, was that I was indeed listening to 24 bit audio through the Studios. How can that be possible when I'm actively streaming and it clearly says 16 bit, 44.1k. It didn't make any sense to me. Once you have the Cube integrated with the Studios, the voice interaction is between you and the Cube, not you and the Studios. Further, if you need the Cube to decode the Dolby Atmos soundtrack, then it stands to reason that the audio decoding is taking place in the Cube, not the Studios. That was my argument to the tech support guy, and he agreed that made sense. So...I've come to find out that the Cube is only capable of 16 bit audio output, not 24 bit. So the Cube is sending the audio to the Studios in lower resolution, not taking advantage of either the Ultra HD tracks in Amazon Music, or the capabilities of the Studio's hi-res audio capabilities.So I cannot natively, in my home theater setup, issue a voice command and have Alexa play back an Ultra HD music file through the Echo Studio speakers. This was a huge let down, especially after making all this investment. But I still had one more test. If I bypass the Cube, and use the Amazon Music app in my iPhone to cast directly to the Studios, then this should give me Ultra HD audio in all its glory. I'm doing this for testing purposes only. I should have to, nor would I want to, whip out my phone in my home theater to play Ultra HD tracks. I should simply be able to issue a voice command to my home theater components, and the Amazon Music app in my home theater system should be doing it for me.The cool thing about the mobile app version though, is when you click on the HD or Ultra HD icon, it displays the full resolution of the track, the bit and sample rates of the equipment it's connected to, and the actual resolution being played. SO now I can validate the bit rate and sampling rate going from my iPhone Amazon Music app directly to the Echo Studios. Only I can't. When I press the Ultra HD icon I get a message that says ""Information not available when casting""! What?? So I can see this info on all my other playback devices such as my car entertainment system, my headphones, but not the Studios? So I still have no idea what the actual nit and sampling rates are bypassing the Cube.Amazon: You are touting the benefits of Ultra HD hi-res audio. You have created an audiophile speaker with the Echo Studio (supposedly) capable of playing 24 bit Ultra HD tracks. But there is no way for me to stream these Ultra HD tracks natively in my home theater, and no way for me to even validate the audio resolution from my phone direct to the Studios. So here I am with all this new equipment and still can't natively enjoy hi res audio through a simple voice command to either my Echo Studios or the Cube. Seems to me the fix would be a software update to make the Cube 24 bit. Please don't make me buy a third 24 bit Cube!","Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2019",AGH7VPPT7KTTVJ4YKF5KVHNAZ7HQ,True,331,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R4J20AT9WBXT1,B07G9Y3ZMC,"4.0 out of 5 stars Honest Review from a Sound Designer, Musician and Video Streaming Nut!",Erik,4,"These speakers are a great value for the money, easy to set up, sound great and overall just an awesome way to transform your home into a theatre like experience. In regards to the reviews from the audiophiles trashing the quality; they're just completely off for what these studios are meant for. Actual studio speakers are meant to sound flat for production purposes. A home entertainment system, unless you're going to pay crazy money, is meant to be loud, clear and not distort. These are great for music and streaming in a living room to give you that theatrical feel. If you want to install an actual theater in your house, then yes, go spend way more money on better speakers.The sounds is really impressive for the price point. I have studio monitors in my music studio that cost hundreds more per speaker, and what can I say? I'm just impressed with what they're delivering for the price.My current set up is a Fire TV Cube with 2 Echo Studio speakers. One placed on each side of the television for a true stereo experience.When listening at really low volumes, I double checked a few times to make sure the sound was coming from speakers because the stereo imaging really is that good. Dialogue centers right to the TV and the ambiance is great, not to mention the panning of sound effects from left to right (you'll feel it when you see that plane fly across screen, bullets fly from one side of the room not to mention movie scores sound great). The room analyzer really is fantastic and uses your walls to reflect sounds for a great experience.The speakers are balanced and my only recommendation for the EQ is to open up the Alexa App, throw your ""Highs"" all the way to the top (to the far right of the slider), your mids to the middle and give yourself just a little boost for the bass. Now we're talking! If you push your bass or mids too far it's going to sound muddy. Again, these aren't studio speakers and I think the EQ provided is more than sufficient.I've tried watching with just one speaker to see how it sounds. The speaker auto adjusts to the room and does give a convincing stereo feel to your experience, however, if you double the speaker, you double the power—this means you're gonna get way more punch and I can't recommend it enough. If you're on a budget or on the fence, just try one.Overall the sound is good, set up is easy and EQing them on the app is a breeze. So big checks for all of these things. Within 30 minutes (read about the delay below) I was re-watching favorite action and sci movies just to hear them in my living room and I was really impressed with the quality of the highs, mids and even the bass. I don't understand why one would invest in the Echo Sub — just get 2 Studio speakers and the combined power of them is going to give them all the ""UMMF"" you need. The woofer in these guys is plenty at higher volumes.In comparison to the apple home pods: As someone who almost exclusively uses apple products, I couldn't be happier with these. Apple is just charging way too much for their speakers for slightly better quality and they will sound not much better to the untrained ear. It's simply not worth the extra money.So why aren't these getting 5 stars? Well to be honest, I wasn't aware that they would only connect as a studio pair with Fire TV over wi-fi. Read that carefully. Yes, they still have a quarter inch in (like for your headphones on your phone) and they are blue tooth enabled, but in order to take advantage of using them in stereo they need to be connected over wifi and so does the sound source. Therefor, you aren't having a party and letting people just connect to the pair to play their music (unless it's one speaker at a time). Not a big deal if it's mainly for entertainment, but I do wish I would have known.In addition to that, one of my primary frustrations was purchasing the Fire TV Cube so we could easily stream 4k media without longer buffering or drop outs. Well, the way you do that is by connecting your Cube to your ethernet. Unfortunately, the stereo pair has to be connected to the Fire TV over Wifi, so that means the Cube has to be connected to wifi as well. They will NOT work for your cube/firestick if you're connected over ethernet. This was a bit frustrating and caused some minor hiccups in my setting up... so instead of 10 minutes it took me about 30 to delete and reinstall the pairs.So this leads me to my one BUYER BE WARE: if you are trying to stream 4k, make sure you have a good internet speed and if not you better have your modem nearby or you'll want to buy a wifi router to plug in to increase the signal near your TV, firestick or cube. In the end, I had a router next to where my TV was to extend our wifi throughout the house, but there's NO WAY everyone has this set up and I would have been really upset if I had major issues watching 4k. Luckily, I have not and I don't have super fast internet (about 55mbps) so I'm hoping most buyers are not put in that position.With that said, I do believe some of this could be fixed with a firmware or software update, so I'm hopeful. If they do, I'd change my review to 5 stars.Overall navigating and using Alexa is what it is and there's plenty of reviews about that elsewhere. One thing to note: if you have the cube and 2 speakers, they do not overlap well when listening for voices. I highly recommend you mute 2 of them (I muted one speaker and the cube with the microphone mute button on top of the unit) so we're only giving voice commands to one speaker.In summary, if you're looking to add theatre like quality sound and punch to your living room, you cannot go wrong with these guys.Make sure you have descent internet for streaming 4k (55mbps or higher) and don't be afraid to play around in the Alexa app to tweak your set up to your liking.Even as someone who lives and breathes audio, I was impressed. Not because they are the best sounding speakers but for what they deliver, how easy they do it and for what price they are doing it at.","Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2019",AECBER7U5OKNMVQB4R73KQH3MMAQ,True,231,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

The sound quality is terrific, but there's a lot of issues & bugs that need to be resolved and smoothed out from the integration of Alexa/Echo Studio and other devices.For example:1) Although I have navigation sounds turned on for my Omni FireTV, Echo either ignores that setting or turns it off. Doesn't matter how many times I turn it back on, it turns it off every time. Before I bought Echo, this issue didn't exist.2) The volume control on my FireTV is stepped from 1 to 100, yet on Echo it's stepped from 1-10. Why this inconsistency in volume control settings among Amazon products? So when I ask Alexa/Echo to change the volume, I only have a range of 1-10, instead of the finer resolution of the TV's 1-100.3) Echo has issues remaining connected to the wireless home network. My wireless router is only 20' feet away, yet it's a regular occurrence for Echo to lose the connection, then create its own ad-hoc network to reconnect. Then it's a PITA process that takes several tries to get Echo to reconnect to your preferred home network. My FireTV has no issues remaining connected to my wireless network and never disconnects or drops it. Why does Echo have this issue remaining connected, even when manually chosen in the Alex app?4) All the different color rings on Echo that mean different things makes you ignore them, because it's ridiculous trying to remember what all the different colors & pulses are supposed to mean when they light up. I ended up saving a PDF doc to my PC & phone that I open when I'm wondering what Echo is doing and flashing certain colors & behaviors. A simple solution would be a concise answer from Alexa if you ask her, 'Alexa...what are you doing?' If we're going to go full-boat on voice control AI, then do it properly & completely.5) Why does Alexa/Echo sometimes alert you to some notifications, but not others? Why do the alerts contain no info or only vague info? Why doesn't Alexa notify me when an Amazon package is delivered, although I have that setting? All these inconsistent/incomplete behaviors are annoying and useless.6) We need an Alexa app for the PC, instead of just the phone app, to control settings for the Echo and other Alexa devices. Please make one for the many who use PC's most of the time for home & work.There's other issues & bugs, but I can't remember them all now.Would I buy an Echo Studio again? Yes, because the sound is great and Alexa is handy to have for some things...but there's also numerous issues to resolve & improvements that need to be made to the Echo Studio & Alexa.","Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2024",AHJK3DQCO27M4MC6UHUTLWQECOMA,True,1,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

I bought it WITH the Alexa studio sub-woofer because I knew I want as 'full' as experience as possible.The old Echo Plus was displaced in my living room by the ""Studio"" and, although the whole set-up was more expensive than I would have liked, it's probably worth it! The sound is REALLY good and makes the Echo Plus (even though the Echo Plus was 'good') sound like a tin can with a string stretched to another tin can. Well, that may be extreme. But still, the Studio version just sounds GREAT! With classical music, the bass added by the sub-woofer is marvelous! To MY ears, there's so much bass in pop music anyway that the added bass seems barely worth it to me. But classical and jazz? Definitely worth it!The set up was really simple. (Getting the Echo Plus to work in another room - which had an Echo Dot in it previously - has so far been fruitless. Nothing I've done in the app or otherwise has succeeded and I hesitate calling Amazon support because (1) I have a phone phobia and (2) that phobia was caused by agonizing attempts at phone support elsewhere.If it's in your budget, the Alexa Studio and subwoofer are sort of 'game changers' in Alexa's world.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AFL5HZCRX7NJF6EE6IMP7KNI5WHA,True,1,Color: GlacierConfiguration: Device only

It has an unforgiving presence, hate it or love it, kinda feel. Not a deal breaker for me but for some people its a viable reason to pass on the Studio.Lets proceed, I am going to be honest, I tried my best to set the speaker up as a home theater system on my own going through the Alexa app. The first of many frustrations to come, I ended up having to factory reset it (deregister it) and call Amazon Alexa tech support to help me set it up. In my defense, I came from Homekit/ Siri/ Apple TV world where things are arguably a little more user friendly. The customer service/ tech support for Amazon Alexa services is outstanding. If I ever have to call them again for any issues, I feel confident that I will get my issue resolved over the phone. Alright so with the assistance of an Alexa technician guiding me through the process we were able to connect my Echo Studio to my Fire TV Cube. Thats what I wanted! It was a longer process than I wanted but I was finally there, probably took a couple hours to fiddle with it including the hold time and assistance over the phone. It is what it is, just a meh moment for me. But now I'm all set up and all is working.Then through out the night we proceed.Flood gates of frustration opens...Before I take a dump on the Echo Studio, let me reiterate when sound comes out of the speaker it sounds really good. Standalone Bluetooth speaker its number one. Its without a doubt should be on anyone's radar looking for one. With the flexibility of all the music streaming services, solid mids and highs and house rattling bass, it is definitely a contender in this space. Price and value alone to me its hands down the winner.Now lets talk about my deal breaking issues with the speaker.Amazon advertises the Echo Studio as a theater system that supports Dolby Atmos using their latest Fire TV Cube, I told you that earlier and thats what lead me down this path. But there are issues on the software side that needs to be addressed before this even gets close to a theater system replacement.Audio and video sync issues. Yes I know you are able to go into settings and tweak this, and so I did... various times throughout the night. It seemed like after awhile the audio and video sync would sway off and I would have to go back into the settings and tweak it again. A high frustration, but forgivable for the price. I could live with it and hope for updates to come with better syncing support. As long as nothing else was an issue I could deal with it, But I am now needing a flawless experience from here on out.Unfortunately, flawless is not in the Studio's vocabulary.Switching between Bluetooth music from my phone and theater system is an absolute nightmare and some how Amazon Music playing from the Fire Cube TV was thrown into the mix as well. Its like Freddy vs Jason, two nightmares into one. The studio can not handle and decide the proper channel to play the media without a little effort on the user end. Its hard to explain but juggling media playback for a theater system shouldn't have multiple sources; Bluetooth and Fire Cube TV that should be it. It seems like both devices are competing for attention, while the speaker should just be a speaker when connected to a fire cube.Side note, ""Alexa, Connect to my phone."" never worked. Studio also has a hard time handling more than one Bluetooth connected device. Had to manually connect my wife's and mine's device each and every time to play music. Also a couple times I had to restart the whole set up because music wasn't playing. Restarted the Fire Cube, Studio, and phone to get music playing. My frustration is building at this point.The final straw though was later that night while watching a show the audio without warning abruptly goes out. Video still playing but the Studio was silent. I was fed up. I wasn't going to bring something in my home that I had to babysit every night. I didn't even try to troubleshoot the issue. I did the final and last factory reset on the Studio and packaged the speaker back up to be returned.I know I am an edge case and I am being extremely critical on some functionality , but at the end of the day, I dont want to deal with any issues. I want to set it and forget it. Give me the same sound and ugly design with a $100 higher price tag but a flawless seamless integration, I would gladly pay. I dont want to have to think when I come home, I want to flop on the couch and just watch tv. Bottom line I wanted to love the Studio, but in the end with all its perks comes unnecessary issues that I dont really need.I DONT recommend it as a Fire TV Cube theater system set up.I DO recommend it as a standalone bluetooth speaker.","Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2020",AG26GMN44OCT7YYAZGHOUDU5IORA,True,23,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R12A3EFAZAF4E2,B07G9Y3ZMC,1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous for disabled or elderly,inger lise,1,"Update 3/30/24. I'm disabled and use a wheelchair. This AI Alexa thing has started doing its own routines and hunches and is now turning off my wheelchair charger at night when it's supposed to be charging-because it hears me go to sleep. It also turns lights off at night that I need left on so I can find my wheelchair. It also decides to turn on every light in the house, whether I want them on or not just because I did once. I thought I had the Alexa hunch issue fixed by deleting all routines and schedules in the app regarding everything! However that isn't a solution either because it turned off the plug for my wheelchair charger again again last night for the fourth time! I woke to a dead wheelchair again this morning! Had to spend the day in bed letting it charge. It's plug had been turned off again during the night! For the app it does this as ""hunches"" and evidently there doesn't seem any way to turn the ""hunches"" off! Additionally, this afternoon I discovered the Studio Sub was offline because it's plug had been turned off too by Amazon Alexa without my permission! It also turns light bulbs off at night when I need them left on so I can see to find my wheelchair! So I called Amazon tech support just now to get help. He wasn't much more helpful than Alexa herself. He suggested I remove the routines from Alexa app. When I told him I'd done had I had already done that days ago but it only helped for a bit,, He had no solutions- no answers beyond apologizing. He did ask though if I was using Apple? So maybe this thing is not Android friendly in spite of them saying it is?My advice is do not get anything relying on Alexa, if you are handicapped or elderly- it extremely dangerous! Amazon AI is not smart enough for disabled or elderly people yet. Alexa also has major issues hearing elderly people who have dentures, or any sort of an accent or speech impediment or stutteringAmazon should buy this stuff back-way too primitive and dangerous.+++ February 2024 update!I've had this speaker for about a month. Also have it's sub. At this moment I'm sitting here spending Friday night typing instead of watching my movie, because the Studio as usualjust disconnected the speakers from the TV with a half hour yet to go on a movie! No sound at all and I can't get it reconnected! The fire stick remote won't work and Alexa Studio just keeps saying something to the effect of ""it's having issues and can't think""..... So I decided to take a break, calm down, and write this review update! Sadly this happens on a daily basis- the connectivity issue with this thing is real, frequent and terrible! The TV, Studio Speaker and Sub are all within 10 feet of our router! No reason for all the issues! When it's good it sounds amazing- but unfortunately having it cut out in the middle of the movie is nothing but frustration. The Studio also has trouble understanding things. It has trouble understanding the simplest of commands and stops movies or YouTube shows, for no reason, or starts talking about topics or showing topics on YouTube that I didn't even ask for- eavesdrops a lot. If I actually need anything Alexa related I usually go back to the bedroom and ask the Echo Dot instead!I had Amazon tech support contact me because of my one star original review and unhappiness with this. They were able to resolve the buzzing issue the speakers had. Turns out moving them further away from our older metal filled TV helps. So they're now 5 ft away from the TV and in the middle of the room and the buzzing issue is resolved.However they're in the middle of the room..... I find the connectivity issue appalling in view of the fact that everything else made nowadays comes Plug and Play!Because of this ongoing issue that Amazon seems to not be able to resolve, I still do not recommend this Studio speaker at all!Original review -This has been a problem since setup- it's definitely not Plug and Play. You would think that something from the same company would hook up easily together, but sluggish updates and incompatible connectivity issues made it take an entire weekend to set up. And if you move it? You have to start all over again. This speaker is buzzy already and I've only had it a few weeks. Have to keep it at low volume which defeats the whole purpose of having it.Additionally it's about half as smart as the Dot I have in the bedroom. 'Studio"" doesn't listen or understand me most of the time. For example, I asked it to play Teskey Brothers. And it starts talking about super bowl instead! And it stops the music on the rare occasions it does play what I want- so it can play commercials for things that it wants to sell from Amazon!I so regret that the return window has passed.Save your money for something else. This thing's 10% enjoyment and 90% aggravation.Not even your worst enemy deserves the frustration this thing spews.","Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2024",AHKQ2TFRETJ6EWN2JZOPVKOULRIA,True,16,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R1K291J1WHOFUX,B07G9Y3ZMC,4.0 out of 5 stars Good sound quality. A small learning curve. Updated review.,Jeb,4,"The media could not be loaded. I'm an audiophile (I love good sound), and this sounds good enough for my kitchen. It gets loud enough for me, but I wouldn't count on it for blasting some ""Snoop Doggy Dog"" at a party (that's an old person joke). I had some trouble learning the command to get it to play music or podcasts when coupled with my other Echo Dot in the living room. It's very specific... ""Alexa play the song Eat It by the band Weird Al on Spotify on the Everywhere group."" It's a mouthful. With little information online I was very frustrated in figuring that out at first, and I had to resort to the Alexa app that you download on your phone for setup to sort-of get the answer. There is a chat bot there which is helpful. Otherwise, not so straight forward, so I'm providing it (the group command) here for anyone else with the same problem. But now that it's working I'm happier with this product. My mother wouldn't be able to set it up alone. You do have to raise your voice over the music to turn it down with a verbal command. One thing I don't like is that when you ask it to play a podcast Alexa reads not only the podcast title of the show she is about to play, but also the description of the show that is usually listed below the title. It can be quite a lengthy description, so she may go on for some time before getting to the play button. Also, unless you pay for Prime Music Unlimited membership some musical functions are limited. Like a few times it wouldn't let me skip forward. That's very frustrating when The Eagles come on. Alexa will prompt you to buy the Unlimited feature with a full pitch that takes a good 20 seconds to ge through before the pesky Eagles resume. Eventually I learned how to shut off this ad, but then I got it again today when I asked it to play Led Zeppelin. Not sure why. Eventually I hope to figure out how to shut off all ads. I also thought this device would speak Chinese, a language I am learning, but strangely it is not included in the list of 20 or so available tongues. Which is a little strange to me since Mandarin is the second most spoken language in the world. Apparently there is a language learning app you can set up, but I haven't figured that out yet. If I do I will update this review. Beyond those issues I'm very happy with this product. If Amazon were to make a home stereo system that was wireless for your entire house, they'd do well.","Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2024",AEY2A4YXRDQK3Z7ZPE56TFSUPSCQ,True,19,Color: GlacierConfiguration: Device only

R2531VWH8P4N66,B07G9Y3ZMC,"2.0 out of 5 stars Mediocre sound, awful implementation.",cowboy,2,"If they made it easier to connect too it would be great. Im considering sending mine back to get a sonos, only because our fire tv wont connect to it, and its such a hassle using a firetv stick on a fire tv just to get audio. If they would push the home theater option to all fire tv's and sticks and what not, it would be an ok setup. But your regular tv wont connect to it, your fire tv wont connect to it. its a real expensive speaker to add to the living room, when its so hard to integrate with the tv.Yes i could buy a echo link. That would solve my problem. But that brings cost of the single speaker audio setup to over $350 after tax and all. You really need two studios and a link for any kind of decent theater audio. That brings total cost too $583 in washington. Tooo much for what it is.You can hear all of the audio coming from the single point of the echo. No technical foolery they are using changes that. Its sound coming from a single point. So get two they say. The echo balls are not a great option because of lack of living room theater mounting options not to mention an audio quality mismatch with the studio. And another studio is darned expensive to fix what they sell as a one speaker theater setup. A sound bar is soooooo much better. Im going to go back to my old boston sound bar in the mean time. Sounds so much better. And i get no single point of sound problem with it.9/3/23 Update: The connection issues have not improved for me yet. Now when i talk to them, at least twice a day, they tell me that cant help me with that because they have dropped internet connection. its not my network. i have no issues with any other devices on my wifi. I believe that the theater wifi connection and the connection to my router is too much for the studios to handle. Probably its a software issue there.However!:I somehow missed that it has an optical input. I have hooked them up via a fiber cable to the tv and now, every single issue ive had with connection to just the tv is solved. Now the only glaring problems is if i want to use more than one device and the constant disconnecting from wifi. I have not been able to get the Theater setup to accept that optical input. If they would allow a theater group to be set up sans TV, and then allow the audio for the group to come from a single optical input on one of the devices, it would be a much more simple and foolproof way to get the audio into the theater system. Connection issues would become far less of a problem. There may be an almost insignificant audio timing issue with that sort of setup, but thats a tiny issue thats not difficult to fix.Anyhow if your looking for a great sound and dont mind the optical cable hooking to the back of your tv, everything including xboxs, playstations, and streaming devices like rokus will send their audio through hdmi to your tv and out via optical to your speaker.My one last thought on the optical cable to solve problems. If you split your optical cable into two, and use two studios like i am on either side of the tv it sounds pretty great, though its not even stereo. The one thing that would make it better is if in the alexa app i could select which channel i wanted to play on each echo unit. The optical is delivering atmos, because im using passthrough on my tv. Each of the Studios could, in their onboard software, selectively play a single channel from that 8.1 channel optical signal. But the whole reason this Studio/Theater software is taking so long to fix glaring issues is because of the cuts in personnel in the alexa/echo branches of amazon. So my hope is very small.9/19/23 update.Im now just pissed i spent the money on them. Ive had them to long for return. They just dont work. The optical connectio has two huge issues. The DAC or something freezes and you get no audio. Have to power cycle the device to get audio back. Which is a real pain since you cant reset it through the app. The ither issue is that there is some insane crackle that goes on with audio being to loud. At those volume its fine if your connected via bluetooth.The atmos is pure fiction with this thing. Songs i know real well are completely missing frequencies and there isnt an eq accessible in the app for the speaker. It needs so much improvement it hurts. Worth maybe $70, only because they can get pretty loud. Complete ripoff otherwise. Trash is what they are as far as i can tell.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2023",AH7ADKRRAGBGOUXFNT53DO2J7ASQ,True,13,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

I remember hearing about the Amazon hardware group suffering cuts last year, so when I saw this thing hasn't been axed yet, I wanted to offer my support since I have loved it for 4 years now.I'm not an audiophile, but I care more about sound quality than your average person. Also, I'm not one of those people that has the luxury of buying 10 different products and comparing them, so my assessment is somewhat limited in that regard. But all that really matters, I think, is that this thing blew me away day one, and it's going strong 4 years later.We have it in our main living room/kitchen/dinette which has 10 foot ceilings and is an open concept with total footprint of about 30'x20' and this thing does a very solid job of filling the room. Of course, bigger, dedicated speakers would sound better, but then you have to screw around with an AV receiver, multiple pieces, running wires (or at least power for each speaker), and trying to make it all look good. This thing looks sleek at one end of the 20'x30' room, has a single necessary cord (power), and provides impressive sound given the tight package everything is crammed in.I understand there are other speakers out there that would sound just as good, if not better (Bose, Sonos, etc.), but I want to emphasize that this is phenomenal for the $200 price point.","Reviewed in the United States April 13, 2024",AH3UO6QEBOMYDI2F446AHSTK425Q,True,7,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

I've got it cranked and it doesn't balance with the mid and highs. Only reason I upgraded was to get a fuller and richer sound. The spatial processing makes the sound worse...at least in the room I have it in. Small room...15' x 15'.*After submitting my review an Amazon Outreach Representative called me to see if they could help and troubleshoot the problem. Basically a reset and maybe move to a different location. So I did and I have to admit, not a whole lot of difference. I did move the speaker closer to where I sit so yes, sound is definitely better but that's just because it's closer. All that being said...I do appreciate that they reached out so they get a star for that. I might still do a full-on factory reset and see what happens...","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AF36GKJIKBEWIBEJGSR7VDRIITEQ,True,1,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R3E072JTKXRRNV,B07G9Y3ZMC,"3.0 out of 5 stars Misleading description, sound quality just decent. Atmos does not work on PC.",D,3,"UPDATE #1: I found out how to control the sound settings. I just decided to try saying, ""Alexa, decrease bass"" and it flashed and while I could not tell for sure, I tried another command, ""Alexa, decrease bass to minimum"" then afterwards I said ""Alexa, increase bass to max"" and there was a significant difference. Alexa confirmed my settings were applied when I tried to increase bass after being already maxed out and Alexa responded by saying, ""Bass is already set to max."" This also works with Treble. Hope this helps some of you out.Dolby atmos does not work on PC and it sounds like a mid to low end stereo over bluetooth. This was confirmed through the Dolby Access app for the PC. I hope to find out that I am wrong about this. I did read that I can supposedly get up to 5.1 surround but it requires another adapter that I just placed an order for and will update to see if it actually works. Aux cable does not register to my PC or smartphone at all and customer service technician could not figure out how to get it to work and stated they will send me an email with instructions within 30 minutes. It has been several hours as of this review with no updates.I always find that most people who say the sound quality of a certain speaker is excellent/audiophile quality usually have no idea what they're talking about. I would bet most are running this over bluetooth and not realizing it does not allow the full features of what this speaker supposedly can put out. It has a punchy bass and that causes the illusion that the speakers sound better. As far as I know, this product requires a cable to utilize its dolby atmos, and the Amazon service tech could not confirm or deny this. However, read the description that says it works with the latest Firesticks and other devices but not with older gen. Perhaps this means for TVs, you can still wireless connect over bluetooth and utilize dolby atmos.I have not tried it on a TV for dolby atmos but as stated above, the description implies you may need to get an optical cable to connect with your TV for the dolby atmos. However, one of my biggest problems with this is that you cannot adjust sound settings. I don't want the bass on at night because I don't want to disrupt my neighbors, and there is literally no way to adjust that or any other highs/mid/lows. I'm hoping the optical cable will allow me to adjust settings with the sound card driver on my PC.On a similar note, it is worth mentioning that not being able to adjust the bass affects the sound quality of movies, as it often adds too much bass to the voices of the actors and sounds odd. Additionally, it adds almost a reverb to the voice, which I tried adjusting through windows sound settings by turning off spatial sound and digital surround. Nothing seems to fix the issue. I have loudness equalization turned on and while it helps movies and music, the Alexa notifications come out at a significantly louder volume to the point where I have to turn it down only to have to turn the volume back up when I resume a movie or playlist.This device doesn't allow you to use the built in mic for the majority of apps outside of Amazon but it will set the default mic on your PC to the Echo Studio. This is annoying because you will have to manually go into every single app that the Echo mic does not work and change it back to your original mic.In any case, until I can hear how it sounds with dolby atmos or even 5.1 surround, I would say do not believe the hype that these are audiophile quality as they sound worse than my $70 bluetooth speakers. These don't sound bad, just don't expect to be blown away over bluetooth.","Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2022",AGHUFB6Z5JSXM2F7WAXFA4S64LDQ,True,4,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R3JKSRM2TPQNT1,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Family approves!,Jason,5,"My reviews are long to provide my reason for purchase, how I like it, etc...if you don't care for all that...here's the short version: Sound is amazing coming from a 3rd Gen dot, not quite the highs or lows a proper speaker setup provides, but it's space saving compared to that and produces very balanced room filling sound.Full Review:I purchased this as an early family present to replace a Gen 3 dot and Gen 1 dot, the sound blows of those away. Even at first plugin, it started up with a tone that more or less spanned the range of what the Studio can handle...everyone's head turned at me in awe, including myself. My family loves music..lots of music...from K-Pop to Metal, and everything in between. The size of the Studio is definitely larger than the dots, comparable to a medium sized pot. While the sound quality is better bthan the Gen 3 dot in both fidelity and clarity, it is still behind proper 2 or 2.1ch+ speaker setups, in case there are some hoping to replace that (again we love music and enjoy it as close to how t was intended). That said, if it'san upgrade to one of the smaller Echo models and/or tired of connecting to a larger speaker system (this is my case) for sound, the Studio is the way to go. The sound the Studio puts out is well balanced: highs, mids and lows are not muddied together nor tinny. The fidelity and clarity is wonderful coming from a single small device and with the multiple speakers built in, the Studio fills a room with sound with ease; whether it be for background music or for listening to the latest album. I still prefer the sound that my tower speakers and sub produces...but it satisfies my families ears without the need to tell Alexa to first connect to speaker...really it's so good that I'm looking into getting a second to further enhance the Soundstage, better separation of left and right, of an already phenomenal Echo speaker.","Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2023",AH5HEZ2BNEI4XPEAR5AHVRVEZK4A,True,1,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
RLM0TLECS5LEH,B07G9Y3ZMC,"4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Dolby Atmos sound, BUT...",Amanda Benson,4,"Pros:If you are using Amazon Music Unlimited and have a large library of Dolby Atmos songs, you will love the depth of sound from the Echo Studio.ConsNon Atmos/360 songs sound like a cheap AM radio. Mono/Echo sounding. You can disable the ""Spacial Enhancement"" option in the Alexa app which helps a little, but the speaker should be smart enough to play lower quality formats.I'm including comments on the Amazon Music app here because the speaker can't be used without ""some"" app, and the Amazon App is what I use.So many things wrong with the app.View library by Album and it sorts by recent activity instead of Album name. Same if you view by artist.If you don't have Music unlimited your playlists are useless. Amazon ""says"" users asked for access to a bigger song library so their solution is to mix random songs into your playlist. BS.They changed the definition of library. My library used to contain songs I purchased and playlists. Now it contains everything.Can't see the quality of the song you are playing. Plenty of room to show it on the now playing screen but they don't. Why? They don't want you to see how many songs are not high quality I guess. Maybe they just have bad designers, developers.No volume control in the app. They have one in the Alexa app. So you have keep both apps running, which you really need to anyway to enable/disable the spacial enhancement option.Optical line-in port is almost useless. Go read the forums. Too much to include here.Seems like every ""enhancement"" they've made to the app lately is a step backwards.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023",AGOXK4UJTB7ZXJUMJXMIA5NSR7AA,True,4,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R1S8CNPBPFMH6J,B07G9Y3ZMC,4.0 out of 5 stars Disappointed if you want to use as a Fire TV speaker .... maybe not so much,Judith F Wagner,4,"I own numerous echo devices, from the Shows to the Dots and Towers and Fire tablets, so I'm all in the Amazon ecosystem. I bought a Fire TV and then this Studio to use as a speaker last year. I have not gotten the Studio to work well with the TV yet. First, I tried Bluetooth, but the sound and lips would not sync, no matter how much I played with it. Then I tried Amazon Home Theater. This eliminated the sync issues, but the TV and the Studio would unpair every couple of DAYS. I did a factory reset on the Studio and then had trouble connecting it to a strong internet signal, so I set it next to the router to connect to the internet. I also tried using an optical cable to hard-wire the two but all I got were crackling noises. So I went back to Amazon Home Theater -- and I always have to reconnect the Studio and TV, after unplugging them both -- a real pain. I was going to get a second Studio and the Echo subwoofer, but not now because of my experience with this Studio and Fire TV (both Amazon products); just not staying connected. If anyone knows how to fix it, please post. ThanksAug 22, 2023. I'm updating my review as Amazon Home Theater seems much more stable, so I'm increasing the stars on the Studio to 4. My main problem was never the sound, but the connection between the studio and my Fire TV. I am only losing the connection between the Fire TV with the Studio maybe once every two weeks now vs. once every two days. I'm pretty sure it's on the Studio side as when I go to reconnect, the Fire TV doesn't recognize the Studio that is sitting next to it. I try the next day and it works. So I'm going to be brave and get the second Studio and see if I can really get a home theatre system going. The home theater still baffles me as I have FIOS's top internet package so it should support everything. To give Amazon kudos, someone called me on this, but I couldn't recreate the problem with regularity, so it was impossible to work with them.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2023",AE4J5S7XQP6KXPRLJNHX6RA3CCWA,True,0,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R22JR4K6G132W6,B07G9Y3ZMC,"3.0 out of 5 stars Hard to review; moments of greatness, let down by buggy music software and variable sound quality",Townie,3,"First unit arrived used and damaged, so Amazon sent me a second that was brand new. We are using both for music (mostly). I use Amazon Prime Music HD and my wife uses Spotify. Spotify works very well and seems to be stable. Amazon Prime Music is very buggy. Firstly, if it continues playing similar music, it always replays the last song already played first. Secondly, it cannot distinguish between different artists with the same name and so you get some random musical styles. Thirdly, the Amazon Music phone app and the device lose sync regularly. The Alexa phone app and the device also lose sync regularly, so there is no way to reliably see what is currently playing. Sometimes fast forwarding a song will cause the message ""an error has occurred"" and sometimes a song will not play even though it is available and has played previously. Sometimes songs that are unavailable will play, which is a bonus...Sound quality wise I find the unit sometimes sounds excellent and balanced and sometimes sounds trebly and sibilant, there is no rhyme or reason to how it will sound. Sometimes the bass speaker will stop working and you have to reboot the unit (I had to reset it and re-set it up from scratch).The front firing tweeter does not produce any sound with spatial audio disabled (and hardly produces any sound with spatial audio turned on). So most of what you hear is the two side firing speakers and the bass speaker (when it chooses to work). The upward firing speaker seems to also only work with spatial audio enabled. This is an issue because spatial audio does not sound good on all material. Material specifically developed with it in mind sounds great, but everything else sounds echo-ey.Note also that there is no volume leveling feature for any of the music services, so you will play one song and then the next will be 5 times louder, so you are constantly asking Alexa to change volume. This is, of course, unless you use it with Bluetooth, but the sound quality won't be as good.As a smart speaker, when the unit works properly it sounds really good - in fact it almost seems to break the laws of physics, it sounds so large. Hopefully there will be a fix for the non-spatial material (getting all the speakers to actually work) and the instability.As for the smart part, it is useful for news and weather, but trying to get suggestions on where to buy something for example comes up with completely inappropriate results. For example, asking where you can buy ""home décor items"" will get suggestions for coffee shops or bakeries mixed in with chain stores. Also, be careful if you banter with the unit because there is a chance you could accidently subscribe to an entertainment subscription service.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2024",AGOW7SHC7JPSTG7R2ITQIPWPRY4A,True,2,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R2PJ2PKBWW4L71,B07G9Y3ZMC,4.0 out of 5 stars Definite audio improvement compared to other echos,Dopest Nerd on the Block,4,"Received the echo studio yesterday, I've only got about an hour of listening in. Wrote the following while listening and setting it up.1. Could not get studio connected to my 5g network, only 2.4g. I haven't looked into it yet.2. Setup and integration into my existing Alexa set-up was easy.3. Looks great4. It's no audiophile speaker but definite improvement over the echo and echo plus.5. Immediately the vocals are center stage. The three 2"" mid driver's project the sound around the room while not letting the vocals get lost.6. The 1""tweeter delivers bright crisp highs7. And having a 5¼"" speaker to handle the lower frequencies in the music really makes this speaker sound and feel like a bookshelf style speaker. I may just have to purchase another for pairing into a stereo set.I'm going to pair the studio with my echo sub just to hear. I've been playing the echo studio for a bit now. Playing songs from different genres, 80's, 90's, 2K, Amazon music 3D, HD, and ultra HD.First impression... Compared to echo and echo plus. Eq flat and spatial enhancement on.1. Noticably louder2. Highs more present and crisper3. Vocals not as muffledI temporarly have the echo studio in a bedroom I converted to a small home theater. Room is 12ftx12ft with 10ft ceiling. Speaker was placed in center of room on foot rest/table. (Amazon suggest having it 6"" from a wall. I'll play with that later when I figure out where it works best in it's possible final destination, the family room.) The echo studio filled the room. I was sitting on the couch in front of the echo studio. With my eyes closed I could follow the sound around the room like a globe. When I would turn off the spatial enhancement you could hear and feel the ""sound globe"" get smaller and closer to the speaker.The first 3d song on the playlist Alexa tells you to ask to play was a bad example. ""The steps"" by Haim. There are weird distortions in the music. I thought too myself (what a wonderful world. You know that's where your brain wanted to go) this is horrible sounding. Turned off the spatial enhancement (SE) and still not good. Went to the next song and was relieved that it was the song and not the speaker.As I said earlier I played a handful of songs from Amazon music. Turning on/off the SE, adjusted the EQ a little. It's tough with Amazon music, the sound quality from song to song (unless they're all on one album) is super inconsistent. You don't notice this on the dot and if your listening you can almost kind of hear it on the echo and echo plus. But it's pretty tough to hear unless you know what to listen for. As the quality of your speaker or system gets better, the distortion, compression become more noticeable. Before subscribing to the HD music I couldn't even listen to Amazon music in my car without cringing from the distortion, inconsistent compression, and/or hollow sounding songs (Lincoln Parks ""hybrid theory"" is a good example of distorted highs. And it sounds like it was recorded in a tin can) HD subscription helps the sound quality a lot but doesn't eliminate the issues.Overall I like what I heard. Definitely need to play with it some more. Let the speakers get broke in. After about 30-50 hours overall sound should warm up and be a bit smoother.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2020",AFCT25XNPMGHORXQWFFD35OH5UIQ,True,2,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R1DBYAELBM6GPR,B07G9Y3ZMC,3.0 out of 5 stars Echo Studio Review and Sonos Speakers,Tall woman,3,"Once I start this review I would like to mention that I did a lot of research before I purchased the Echo Studio product. My 7 year old Sony sound bar for my TV suddenly died and was not fixable or in order to fix it was too pricey. Let me first say this product is for a second home and the room functions as a bedroom and entertainment room. This room is not a home theater so what I am trying to describe is I didn’t need a robust sound system based on the room size and function. Also, I did want a system (speaker) where I could listen to music and have good sound from the TV. Finally, I should mention I have Play1 Sonos speakers (1st Generation so no smart functions) at my primary home. Okay, understanding all those areas let me provide my review…I have had the Echo Studio for about 2 ½ months and the sound is very good with the music and playing through the TV in the size of the room as I described above. The smart functions are nice to have but I will be honest I don’t really need to have them. Based on the research I did and reviews on Amazon and outside of Amazon said the sound from speaker was almost as good as the Sonos play1 speakers and I have to disagree. My personal opinion is the sound from Sonos is much better and the functions with Sonos app are 95% better for music lovers. What do I mean by that statement is I feel there are limits with the Echo Studio based on functions and performance for music lovers or as a primary speaker for music and tv in a smaller size room. The following list below includes the limitation of the echo studio.• Always defaults to Amazon Music ( I recently changed the function within the app to my favorite music platform but Alexa still goes to Amazon music but not as much). If I want it to go to a favorite station of mine I need to be specific in my statement by naming the station exactly. And I am finding this very annoying b/c on my Sonos I have them saved and just go to the app and play them. So I have to look them up everytime if I want the echo studio to play them. This is a big fail for me.• Unable to save favorite stations• Doesn’t have the capability to store recent playlist or station. For example, if I like what Alexa did pick I say save that station and she communicates that function does not exist.• Also, I don’t find the Alex app helpful when it comes to the music element as the Sonos App is. Sonos app is seamless to me. Also, I love the Sonos app in terms of saving the history of what the user has listen to and I can store favorites.• The search function in the Sonos app is great because I can see all the options to play from all my linked music platforms. I want to communicate to those individuals who are music lovers and are using many online platforms for their music. And understanding the difference between the two products. If you are reading this review and your in the market in purchasing a speaker for music and to play through the TV. I would highly recommend Sonos speaker b/c it is seamless more flexibility and more functions within the Sonos app that is not offered through the Alex app. This is why I am doing this review b/c that was not mention in my research and if I had known I would have spent more money for those functions and flexibility. I realized that I did get a better price but for me at what cost. I will say I am good with my echo studio and it does sound good. But if I had known what I know now, I would have gone with a Sonos speaker.

RJHIL4FZZLP6R,B07G9Y3ZMC,"5.0 out of 5 stars If you are a Koolaid drinking Prime movie and music subscriber, you need this...",GreatNorth,5,"To start with: the Amazon Music App and Alexa app don't play nice together, but its getting better; Alexa app likes priority power! Also flipping from app to Fire 4K Max has interface issues. It's getting old unpairing speakers and clearing caches... When music or movies stop for 10 minutes, it should default to next command pinging it and not mate for life!!....The software issues aired... I bought two of these with the sub to justify my monthly unlimited music fee along with the Prime membership; both of which keep going north.... I am old enough to remember when the Dire Straights Brothers in Arms CD DDD cost $26 bucks, but if you had a CD player, this was a life changing listening experience! So I'm conditioned within reason, but am a frugal value buyer.I am a self proclaimed audiophile, but that is arbitrary based on your music, room, ears and budget, but I have always paid up for ""Hearing"" sound value. A $10k amp/pre sounds only as good as your speakers. No the Studios aren't that, but for a smart Alexa speaker you can't engineer or make a speaker set for your $200 investment. Amazon is even or losing on selling these to get you enrolled in the unlimited music; HD, ultra HD, Atomos, 3D etc... and it works. Very smart.Will they make a TV sound experience better, obviously, compared to factory tv pairings. Will they play your music subscriptions epic on your go to listening personal high end system, blow your hair back, chair? That is your call. Prime: return if not. My easy answer is that Amazon doesn't currently make a better speaker with the versatility the studio has, and I own everything they sell related to sound... truly.Amazon isn't intentionally trying to price themselves out of the music streaming services and the value here is that they are committed to getting it right. Many of the settings adjustments have been firmware updated to work as it should of been from origin, but tip of the hat for addressing weaknesses. Most high end audiophile speaker companies aren't going to swap out the cross-overs or update the digital footprint because you spent $35k on a set of speakers you think should clear the air better. Get a calculator out. $200x amazon customers, x customers who subscribe to music and movies..... it's millions$$$! Amazon will stay proactive and reactive when necessary to keep us happy! Buy the speaker/s, it's a brilliant 150-200 dollar investment considering a tank of gas is $100. Money well spent, stress well relieved and a chance to re-listen to music, that doesn't sound the same as it did over the years. It's incredible what smaller size chambers/arrangements deliver these days, it's a new digital ballgame; Get in it!","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2022",AFQHYJRRFLPGLCLZ6L5J6K7WJTRQ,True,17,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R2D8D7TKTGVPE7,B07G9Y3ZMC,"4.0 out of 5 stars Echo Alexa Clarification on ""Spatial Audio"" and MORE...",Rob in Boston,4,"""Spatial Audio"" is NOT A SETTING on Echo or Alexa. It's a playlist that you must request verbally while operating Alexa once you have Amazon Music Unlimited (which you must purchase additionally as with other music platforms.) If you are already an Amazon Prime member, the added five bucks is worth it. With Amazon Music Unlimited, Alexa becomes your slave). Understand, with basic Amazon Music, the sound is suppressed (It sucks.) It's better to fork out a few more bucks for the Unlimited (and you're the boss). 2) Once you pay for Amazon Music Unlimited, the sound improves significantly. 3) ""Spatial Sound"" IS NOT A SETTING for your device. It's merely a marketing ploy. It's simply a playlist that only works if you subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited. THERE IS NO SETTING ON ALEXA FOR ""SPATIAL SOUND."" Once you have Amazon Music Unlimited, you say to Alexa (on your Echo device), ""Alexa, play the best of spatial audio playlist."" What you get is random pop music, most of which is redundant and not rewarding. Keep your settings basic. Do get Amazon Unlimited because you are in command. You can skip without suppression at any time. If you ask Alexa a general question, it's usually okay, but sometimes it's ridiculous how badly a question can be misinterpreted. I like my Echo Studio. It doesn't allow much finessing of the volume. I'm searching for a compatible 16 band equalizer (which probably doesn't exist) but it tells you I'm encouraged by the sound of this device. Don't be confused about ""Spatial Audio."" Also, keep the basic sound settings once you have the Echo Studio speaker. You can adjust simply by commanding: ""Alexa bass up,"" or ""Alexa, mid rage down,"" Or, ""Alexa Treble up 1,""etc. The same with volume. That's all I got. Don't want to overwhelm, but you need to know this stuff to get your money's worth.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2023",AFOXPE3SBO2H77JAPYDWAJHXMRTQ,True,6,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
RFQSXWQ0JW1MO,B07G9Y3ZMC,4.0 out of 5 stars Review of Echo Studio when paired with second Studio and the Echo Sub,Greg W.,4,"While it is true that, to date, the Echo Studio paired with another and the Echo Sub is one of the best ways to listen to Amazon Music Unlimited, there are some drawbacks.The first is probably the price. You really don't need to pair two together if you can't afford it and the Echo Sub does not automatically add as much bass by default as you would like.I don't want to split hairs, but the Echo Remote works with the Echo Studio much better in one-speaker format.In paired mode, you can sync the remote, you can change the volume, and bypass the wake word with the press of a button, but you can't skip forward or go back with two of them working as a 2.1 system just with a press.I hope Amazon addresses this with a software update or that I am the only one for whom this happens. I sincerely doubt Amazon addresses this as they do not sell the remotes on their website anymore. It's a shame. I really prefer using the remotes.When you set these devices up on your smartphone or tablet, I learned the hard way that you need to re-enter your same address multiple times and label your rooms correctly for the sake of organization and using the drop-in feature.As for the sound quality of the streamed music, it's very good, but not excellent.It's very difficult for streamed music to sound great. I've listened to vinyl records and CD's and DVD Audio and music that was advertised as lossless, but streaming music for the time being is compressed by algorithms. Most people know that. And you know you're being robbed of sounds or data that make the file small enough to stream.If you are an audiophile, buying one of these Echo Studio devices was never on your to-do list.But the Echo Studio makes for a decent smart speaker. I like that I can control the thermostat and dim lights without spending much effort.I've owned previous generation Echo devices that had built-in thermometers. The Studio dropped that feature.I should tell you that I have also used Google Home and it seems to be more capable of answering my more complex questions.Yes, your smartphone is smarter. Your computer is obviously smarter.Basically, what I am saying is the Echo Studio is better than previous models from Amazon.I got what I paid for because I had realistic expectations. And it sounds very good on its own.I like that it adjusts to the acoustics of the room automatically when moved to new locations.To sum up: I like it. It has its limitations, but I like it.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2021",AGS5EEI55HXVRY7CXEEEHPB4OB2A,True,0,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R32FSCMBJUAVPY,B07G9Y3ZMC,"4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good speaker, bad exchange policy and service.",TheFirstMongoose,4,"Pretty good speaker. Bad exchange policy and customer service. I purchased two of these on Prime Day, since they were $50 off MSRP for a total of $100 savings. Tested both of them out and paired them together with the Echo Sub. Played music fine. Somewhat drowned out the bass from the subwoofer, but music was nice and clear. There really is no way to independently turn up the bass just on the Echo Sub since they are all connected now(two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub). Amazon needs to invest in these tweaks that would make a big difference.I discovered a day later that one of the Studios had a low static noise whenever I asked Alexa a question. It wasn’t on the other one/speaker. So I tried to troubleshoot and went through everything. Changing the WiFi band from 2.4 to 5.0 and back. Changing to different outlet. Unplugging for a few minutes. Nothing worked. Very noticeable if your within 3 feet and asking Alexa a question. When playing music however, the static seemed to disappear or so I thought. When the music is turned down, the static was still there. So I decided to call Amazon technical services. A tech/representative went through all the troubleshooting methods I had already tried and we determined that the speaker was faulty. I agreed to just have it replaced. When he was telling me on how to ship the faulty speaker back, he mentioned to not include any cords or pamphlets. That raised a red flag and I asked if I was receiving a new or refurbished unit for a replacement. He said he doesn’t know or would not know until it ships. So I end the call with him and go to my Amazon account to look at the replacement being shipped. It’s a REFURBISHED! Nothing wrong with refurbished, but I bought new not refurbished. So Amazon should be replacing with a new one. Right out of the box there was a static. It’s not like I used it for a month. So I called back and tried to explain to a different representative. Come to find out, Amazon’s policy to correct such issues is either to refund your money or replace with new OR refurbished unit(their call), when it comes to Amazon devices. My argument is that this is a brand new device that was defective, sending a refurbished one should have NEVER been an option. What complicates thing now even more is that they are out of stock on new Studios. None expected in until a month and a half later. The second representative ended up canceling the refurbished replacement and said I can wait until they get new Studios in to do the exchange since she can’t even order a replacement due to the lack of stock. Either case, I’m not very happy on how this was all handled. Decent sounding speaker, but if you get a lemon, be prepared to get a refurbished one as an exchange. Or be vigilant like me and question it. I did notice other reviewers stating receiving replacements coming in generic boxes....those are refurbished. And there’s nothing wrong with refurbished if you originally bought refurbished or if you have owned that device for a number of days, weeks, months. That wasn’t my case. Brand new out of the box with a static noise and wasn’t offered a new replacement.","Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2020",AGHVYW7ZSEDM5NYEHVUUGLRSFCWA,True,13,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R1RN10WMSRQ3KP,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic sounding speaker that'll have me selling my Sonos & Apple Homepod.,Robert M.,5,"I'll get the conclusion out the way: The speaker sounds surprisingly greatFor context, I own 2 Sonos One speakers and an Apple Homepod. I've always been lukewarm on the Sonos as their sound, while fairly good, doesn't match their price in my opinion. The Homepod, too, has always felt overpriced if not a decent sounding speaker.When the Echo Studio was announced, I figured I'd give it a shot given I could always send it back with Amazon's excellent return policy if it didn't live up to snuff. $200 put it below the Homepod and right around the Sonos One pricepoint so my expectations were set around there.Setup was simple as the device came pre-linked with my Amazon account. It goes through an initial room test where it plays some tones to measure the size and placement within the room (something it does continually should you move it around anyway). After that, all that was left was to listen to some music.I started with some Sinatra to get a feel for the vocals, and was immediately impressed with the tone & clarity. You could easily pick up on the subtle percussion on the background and the band hits packed a punch when they came in behind him. Next I tried some classical to get a feel for the range and, again, came away impressed. You could feel the lows of the brass section just as well as the high strings. The material was all represented well.Ok, so how about something that thumps. I asked Alexa to play some Chemical Brothers and this is where I got really impressed. Too many speakers, in my opinion, emphasize the volume of bass over accuracy. You end up with a boomy sound that doesn't reflect the music properly. Not the Echo Studio. The bass was punchy, loud and accurate. I tried some Daft Punk and Deadmau5 and came away equally impressed with the tight bass and crisp highs.Next I tried some Metallica. I feel if there's a critique I'd have with the Echo Studio it'd be here. The mid guitars lack a little feel and all start to sound a bit muddied together. You get the bass, you get the highs, but the guitars lack a little range. This isn't at all uncommon on speakers like this (the Sonos are quite bad in this regard in my opinion), but it could definitely be better).I tried a handful of the 3D audio selections on Amazon Music. In short, you do get a wider soundstage which is interesting, but you lose something in the clarity of the music. It feels a little gimmicky maybe, but not necessarily in a bad way. Just an ""I don't know if this is actually an improvement or not"" kind of way.In short, I'm very, very impressed with the Echo Studio. It's priced right at $200, has tighter and more accurate bass than the Homepod and a much fuller range than the Sonos One. If you're looking for a good speaker for music (with the bonus of having Alexa built in), I can't recommend this one enough.I came in skeptical. I came away impressed.","Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2019",AGEO4KHJNLTE7T5EEH7TMYYB6PRQ,True,22,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

RMER9EFHP21YP,B07G9Y3ZMC,3.0 out of 5 stars Good as a single basic speaker but not for home theater,andrescolombia,3,"The Echo speaker I recently tried out is decent for basic functionalities but falls short in some key areas, particularly as a home theater option and its connectivity with Fire Stick. The speaker's limitations become evident when you push it beyond basic use. When attempting to use it as part of a home theater setup, the Echo speaker simply doesn't deliver the immersive audio experience needed. The sound lacks the depth and richness required for watching movies or playing high-definition content. It might be adequate for occasional TV shows or background music, but it cannot replace a dedicated home theater system.The connectivity with Fire Stick is another significant drawback. The pairing process is cumbersome and often unreliable. Even when connected, there is noticeable lag and occasional audio dropouts, which can be quite frustrating. This inconsistent performance severely undermines its utility as a companion to the Fire Stick, especially if you are looking to enjoy a seamless streaming experience.In summary, while the Echo speaker is a competent device for basic tasks and casual listening, it is not suitable as a home theater alternative. Additionally, its poor connectivity with the Fire Stick makes it a less-than-ideal choice for those looking to integrate it into their entertainment setup. If your needs are simple, this Echo speaker might suffice, but for more demanding audio and streaming applications, you might want to look elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2024",AFTJVJJXAQQQNXYG5XV2TM5GPUXA,True,1,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R3SQY6FL92RWFI,B07G9Y3ZMC,"4.0 out of 5 stars Studio is a stretch, but certainly the best sounding Alexa device.",Jeff Helmes,4,"Alexa works flawlessly. Big plus since I bought it to replace a glitchy stereo pair of 3rd Gen Echoes in bedroom used for music & ocean wave sounds to help drift off to sleep. The stereo pairing suffered frustrating dropouts, with one or sometimes both speakers quitting in the middle of songs & very rarely played the ocean sounds through morning. But so far the Studio has worked perfectly.However, in spite of the Dolby Atmos credentials, the Studio doesn’t sound nearly as spacious as the paired Echoes (which I had in opposite corners of the room on the headboard wall, mounted about 5 feet high on candle sconces.) Paired also with an Echo Sub, this filled the room with sound rather nicely... well, whenever it all worked simultaneously. But the glitches simply became untenable, so I grabbed a Studio during Prime Day...At first I put the Studio near a corner of the room on a dresser, pointing the front toward the bed. Sounded tinny. Made sure I had upgraded to Amazon HD & played Best of 3D... Still barely any immersion of sound whatsoever. Very disappointing. Moved speaker to center of wall, still on dresser... Better but still not very impressive. (And yes I did keep the Echo Sub, now paired to the Studio.) I let it play all day while at work to break in the speaker & allow the room tuning to recalibrate... No avail.Finally I moved the Studio to a speaker stand, centered on the far wall facing the bed. The sound was significantly improved. Still not what I’d expect from a product claiming Dolby Atmos, but certainly better sound immersion. I think the side-firing speakers work far better in space, rather than bouncing sound off a near surface. Clearly the Studio is intended to point at the listener’s face & it must to achieve any reasonable degree of sound immersion. Regardless I did prefer the sound of paired Echoes with Sub over the Studio + Sub... but not enough to go back to all the frustrating glitches.No doubt paired Studios would sound better than the paired Echos, but I don’t want to return to the annoying dropouts. Besides for $300-400, a stereo pair of Sonos Ones would be better sounding with rock solid reliability.Bottom line is I will stick with the Studio because it has been so reliable & good enough sounding for a bedroom. The Echo pair absolutely demanded a Sub for quality music. However the Studio doesn’t depend on it since it has a woofer, unlike all other Echoes. So at $150 (on sale) I would recommend a Studio for a bedroom or kitchen where music will be played, but stereophile audio quality isn’t required. But for a living room or den where you may prefer excellent sound quality, I would highly recommend a Dot & a stereo pair of Sonos One SLs, or better yet the Sonos Five.","Reviewed in the United States October 27, 2020",AFE34T7J4PA4UBVAWCSE3BY7MHIA,True,1,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

I bought two of them and have them paired up. So far it has been amazing. Here's what I love about them:- In paired mode, the speakers sound incredible. I have tried both ""spatial"" and ""non-spatial"" settings and both sound pretty good.- I recently upgraded my fire TV to a fire stick 4K and the dolby sound that comes when watching a movie/show is outstanding- Speaker is so good that I sold off my regular speakers which were really nice, but I truly don't need them anymore- microphone pickup is outstanding. even if music is playing I can say Alexa and usually it hears me- When compared to the google mini I had, I notice that the home automation stuff I have is faster. Like ""Alexa turn on kitchen light"" it responds instantlyCons:- I have spotify and frankly spotify integration sort of sucks. I can't say ""shuffle music"", i doesn't work. if i say ""play more songs like this"" it doesn't work. playing of music will just stop mid-stride for no reason. even ""play that song that goes shake it like a polaroid picture"" doesn't work. i'm really disappointed with spotify on echo studios. so i tried out amazon music with a free offer, and guess what? of course everything works perfectly. i'm a little bit bothered that i may have to migrate from spotify or change to a different type of speaker. with my google mini, spotify worked perfectly.- i have my speakers paired, and because of this, using the communication feature of the echo studio when paired doesn't work. i found out it will only work if i unpair the speakers. i submitted a bug but there's been no fix for weeks. irritating!- the speakers can be buggy. sometimes the speakers will unpair for no reason. i had initially setup my speakers on a different wi-fi network name. so i changed it to the one I want. i went to amazon and told it to not remember any old wi-fi names. but for some reason, they would randomly re-connect to the old connection. I finally did a factory reset and did it all again and now it seems to work without switching back.Pretty much what I have come to believe/realize is that these speakers are all about the amazon echo-system. I don't see a priority for it to work with spotify because they want you to switch to amazon music. The hardware itself is great, so I may actually follow what they planned and switch to amazon music. But I'm irritated about it. The alexa app is okay, but kind of buggy.So I would've given it 5 stars, but give it 4. I'm still extremely happy because I love the sound from teh paired speakers. and watching movies with atmos is amazing, like for the first time i feel like you can hear sounds coming from the side or further away or atmospheric sounds. my old home theater system never sounded this good.If you're a huge spotify user, I'd stay away and maybe go for the Sonos. But if you're ambivalent about your music service, this works perfect with amazon music. And so far with my fire stick 4k the sound with the paired speakers is amazing.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2020",AF6VS6H6CI4SH6K3VNI4WTDDURRA,True,3,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R2CBUR91SFMZ2N,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Immersive Sound Experience with the Echo Studio,Morgan,5,"Pros:1. **Exceptional Audio Quality:** The Echo Studio lives up to its claim as Amazon's best-sounding smart speaker, delivering an impressive audio experience with clear highs, rich mids, and deep bass, providing a well-rounded sound profile.2. **Dolby Atmos Support:** The inclusion of Dolby Atmos enhances the audio immersion, creating a three-dimensional sound experience that adds depth and realism to music, movies, and other audio content.3. **Spatial Audio Processing:** The spatial audio processing technology contributes to a sense of surround sound, making the listening experience more immersive and engaging, especially for those who appreciate a high-quality audio setup.Cons:1. **Large Size:** The Echo Studio's substantial size may be a drawback for users with limited space, as it requires a significant footprint. Consideration of available space is essential before incorporating it into your home.2. **Higher Price Point:** While the audio quality justifies the cost, the Echo Studio's higher price may be a limiting factor for budget-conscious consumers seeking a more affordable smart speaker option.3. **Alexa Integration Learning Curve:** For users new to smart speakers or voice-activated assistants, the integration with Alexa may take some time to master. Learning the various voice commands and features could be challenging for beginners.4. **Limited Color Options:** The availability of the Echo Studio in only a charcoal color may be a limitation for those who prefer more diverse options to match their home decor.Final Statement:The Echo Studio undoubtedly stands out as a top-tier smart speaker, offering an unparalleled audio experience with Dolby Atmos and spatial audio processing. While its size, price, and learning curve with Alexa may be considerations, the exceptional sound quality makes it a worthwhile investment for audio enthusiasts. I highly recommend the Echo Studio for those who prioritize an immersive and high-fidelity audio experience in their smart home setup.","Reviewed in the United States November 9, 2023",AFVLIAEZUT352MSUCI5JDEBREIMQ,True,8,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R1HJ6R7ENNCC2G,B07G9Y3ZMC,3.0 out of 5 stars This is NOT the sound you were looking for,n0nuf2,3,"Good day Amazon!So, I've had a pair of Gen2 Echo+ and Echo Sub for some time. I like overwhelming bass in all music; I don't want to have the volume on +10 to feel the bass. The Echo 6"" sub is decent for what it is. I have the two Echo+ and Sub stereo grouped with FireTV Cube for 2.1 sound while watching TV (only from FireTV). Sounds very good for what it is. Now I've purchased 2 Echo Studio speakers as well in hopes the larger drivers will 'fill' the bottom end. Honestly, if you like your head ripped off by too much midrange (1K, 1.2K, 5K, etc), then these are for you; The Studios have no 'heart'. I used to run sound for our band and I know when there's too much of something in the mix; FWIW. I turn the Studio mids all the way down -6 and drop the treble to -2 and set bass to +6 then the Studios sound just 'ok'. So, I paired my Echo Sub with the Studios to see if that balances it out. Nope... No matter what I set the EQ to or turn spatial on or off, makes no difference with any kind of music (3D or not). The Studios actually attenuate the sound coming out of the Echo Sub. Far less bass paired up with Studio than Echo+. I'm seriously considering returning the Studios and getting 2 more Echo+ and another sub. (all of this stuff would benefit from more user EQ and crossover adjustment). In a final attempt to get 'MY' preferred sound out of all of this I created an Echo+ stereo pair with the Echo Sub, then just stereo paired the Studios together, set all EQ accordingly, then created an ""Everywhere"" group out of all of that. In that configuration the Studios aren't attenuating the sound from the sub. One would think that the size of the drivers on the Studio would trump the Echo+ as far as low end, but nope. W/e these things are doing is wrong IMO. It is true that Studio is clearer than Echo+, but to what end? Not a good one IMO... When I turn the EQ to +6 Bass, I expect the thing to thump (within reason for a 4""+ woofer). If I had a wish it would be that Amazon Echo releases an 8"" 800+ watt Echo Sub (with a decent user adjustable EQ) so those of us who LIKE the low end more than screaming mid range can manually shape the sound and get the sound they want. All in all, after trying high-end Apple, Sonos, Google, Bose and a few other expensive options side by side (yes, bought them all at the same time and tried at same time, then returned the others), the Amazon speakers sound the best, and are the clearest. (By the way, don't believe what you hear in the store or the sound demos... The acoustics are NOT the same as the environment YOU will be using them, and their ""demos"" are adjusted to make 'their' device sound better than it is with real music). I wish I knew where to post this comment that Amazon team would read it; probably wouldn't matter. LOL. All aforementioned devices have been tested on a 400GB connection with Amazon Music, Google Music, Pandora, Spotify, several other streaming services, as well as Bluetooth music from multiple devices. Agree/Disagree, there's my experienced 10 cents worth opinion for anyone considering these devices.I own a LOT of Echo devices and can't wait for new better Echos to be released. I just hope the Studio is NOT where they are going in the future... Don't get me wrong, it's a nice speaker, but not everyone wants screaming mid range. Example, most everyone I've EVER met uses a "" V "" or "" W "" configuration in their EQ. That represents CUTTING most of the screaming mid range.

We love that you can control the hdmi ports and everything with the cube remote/alexa by telling her. I Think its awesome, you want to play video games alexa switch to hdmi 3, ok.So in the mornings getting the family ready for the day, and when I am working from home I love to have the news on in the background. I notice news12 app doesn't work (local live news app) , do everything, delete cookies, cache, delete redownload the app. So im like EFF IT, put on sling, I Guess im effen stuck with fox/abc, well those won't work with live tv either! wait look amazon has a live news app, download that, oh look that doesn't work either. I factory reset the cube, reset everything back up still doesn't work, even tried hard wiring the cube to the internet to make sure it wasn't our wifi (even though we have 2 fire sticks, and a tv that are working fine with all the apps and live tv). Still doesn't work.Speak to amazon they work me through everything, still nothing works, they send me a new cube. Set it up, didn't connect it to the speakers, live tv works fine, HOOOOOOOORAY LOOK AT THIS LIVE TV WORKS FINE! Now I can catch up on this whole coronavirus news lmao. Time to set up the speaker group (I mean I just spent $600.00 on amazon speakers to use with the tv/music I mine as well use them) . Live news worked for literally 5 seconds, then freezes. We reset the router, hardwire it, update it, delete cookies and did a little dance and said some prayers around it, still nothing worked for live tv. My husband swears its some kind of cube bug maybe that live tv just doesn't work with it, I said ehh maybe its the speaker group (2 amazon echo studios and subwoofer which happen to be the reason I even bought this god damn cube). I forget the group, live tv starts right up.In my opinion this should be a glitch worked out before making people buy this device to work with all of these expensive amazon speakers. Some might even be like why do you need stereo surround sound to watch to watch the news? I don't.. but what about sports events, or if I decide to watch a show when it airs instead of pre recording? none of that works. So in a weeks time I spend about $650.00 on an amazon entertainment system that doesn't work. I was already upset that I couldn't hook up a bluetooth device to my entertainment group (I would like to play records on the 2 studios and subwoofer) and can't do that, but now this? Amazon please come up with a resolution asap. Once you do, let me know and you will get 1000 stars.","Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2020",AFKDUPX6QR4VIFF2PANI2M5LOLRQ,True,2,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R2P5HEAOBR8S3Z,B07G9Y3ZMC,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound but still very glitchy,Mike,4,"These sound amazing, so much so that I bought a second one and am running them in stereo. Highly recommended versus the single unit. As good as it sounds, it’s still one unit. Two brings them to life. The sound is crisp, clear and loud as you want it. They sound amazing. No complaints.Alexa is still glitchy though. Sometimes it takes a couple requests to get the song to play. Sometimes it takes like 20 seconds to play the song…. The single echo dot always loaded the song immediately, so it seems an issue with the Echo Studio.I have them set up to my FireTV. This is great and the sound is awesome…. But sometimes the TV turns on or off and sometimes there’s no sound and….TL;DRThese things sound AMAZING, but they’re still annoyingly glitchy.","Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2024",AHAWXDGMCMMBHC37G2K5FFCS2ZBQ,True,0,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R1M9FLG0AEAAC4,B07G9Y3ZMC,4.0 out of 5 stars *Fixed - Issue with Studio/Sub pair at first but now stellar.,AC,4,"I have a myriad of Echoes around my open-floor plan house including five Echo Subs for whole-home audio but some of my Echos are 1st generation. When this game-changer, Echo Studio came out, I was hoping to up the ante by replacing my old Echoes with a few Studios so I started out with one.First, its greatest feature: the room-measuring, self-adjusting, high-tech “spatial” processing must be disabled in order to hear the highs, at least to my ears. That’s okay since I don’t really care about spacial whatever, I just want to crank it up!One important feature for me is the ability to pair the Echo Studio with my Echo Sub and enjoy the bass from both devices at the same time. After all, for twice the price, I want twice the bass, right? That’s where I ran into problems.I initially setup the Studio and played some tunes which sounded spectacular. Then, I eagerly set up my sub and paired it to the Studio, imagining what twice the bass was going to sound like. The pairing went fine with no hiccups. Then I added the new pair to my “Everywhere” group which also went fine. I played some music on my Everywhere group where the Studio performed well again BUT there was nothing coming out of the Echo Sub it was paired with.I paired, unpaired, paired again, deleted and reinstalled both but the result is the same: the Studio vibrates for all its might while the Echo Sub it was paired with sat completely silent. I was heartbroken, wondering why the Studio would play all the bass and deprive a dedicated Echo Sub from playing any of it!Amazon tech support actually called me to try to sort out the issue and assured me the Studio should, in fact, play nice with the Echo Sub as they have an identical setup in their own testing room. The tech verified on her screen that the Studio and Sub were active and linked together in a sub pair I labeled “TV room sub pair” in the Alexa app.However, I only over tested the setup by playing music on my Everywhere group. The tech asked me to first play music specifically on my “TV room sub pair” and suddenly my Studio and Sub came alive together! Then, I tested music on my Everywhere group again and lo and behold, the Studio and Sub played together, giving me the bass I wanted.I don’t know how or why but I learned: 1. Pair the Studio with the Sub and give the pair a name in the Alexa app, “TV room sub pair” in my case. 2. Ask Alexa to play music, specifically using that pair’s name. It is not enough to just walk up to the Studio and ask Alexa it to play a tune because only the Studio will play and the Sub will sit silent. 3. After playing a tune to ensure the Studio and Sub work together, THEN add the pair to my Everywhere group.Thanks Amazon tech girl!Rock on.","Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2019",AHHUPZU72BOUDIQW4OGLM2OYGX7A,True,8,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R1O9E196G6AFTV,B07G9Y3ZMC,"4.0 out of 5 stars Sound is fuller, more clear, bass OK, attractive design",Grayslake,4,"Have two of these now. Bought to replace older Echo Dot pancake, plus older Echo cylinder models (reused elsewhere). Sound is noticeably better and more clear. Bass is there, but in a speaker so small bass performance is limited no matter what. At high volume, this speaker gets a bit muddy. At reasonable levels, it has pretty good midrange performance for voices, most music. Higher frequencies are edgy depending on volume. Found setup with Alexa pretty easy and done in less than a minute. Attractive design too. Conclusion: works much better in small rooms for music listening, but otherwise useful in any room. NOTE: initially had connection issues with my second studio speaker. It was no more than 3 feet from the router through a regular drywall wall. It would lose connection or I would get the famous I can’t understand right now message. Found that positioning the unit is everything as far as connectivity. I moved it about 8 feet away against an opposite wall. It connected fine and stayed connected. No dropouts. I think the positioning of the antennas inside of it. Have a lot to do with peoples connectivity problems. Experimentation with location is needed.","Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2023",AHZEWGOS4ME3RG5PXMQEUXECHFDQ,True,2,Color: GlacierConfiguration: Device only
