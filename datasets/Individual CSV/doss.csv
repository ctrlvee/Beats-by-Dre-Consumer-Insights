R3Q653V0R49KII,B0CZN6J824,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound quality,Lorissa Petersen,5,Very easy to hook up to Bluetooth. We use this outside for our pool and the lights at night time look amazing.

R16NFLZ1L7PFPO,B0CZN6J824,5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome!,cali,5,"I read some of the bad reviews on this item and still don‚Äôt believe it, because this speaker is on my top 5 items that I have bought so far in 2024. It is very powerful sounds good even at about 75 percent of volume! It has that old school weight to it that in my book spells quality! No issues what so ever! We all know how scary it is nowadays to buy things especially online, but this is one thing that you will NOT! regret buying. üíØ percent satisfied! And I must admit I didn‚Äôt expect this to be this good for the price. In closing I am a musician so I listen to a very large range of music from the 1930‚Äôs through 2024! And no matter what type of music you listen to it comes out great sounding.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AEKMMF66V5OK33OMMDISBH4ECVKA,True,4,Color: Orange

R2YOCBN1M9NXHI,B0CZN6J824,5.0 out of 5 stars Review updated,Amazon Customer,5,"Updated: I have updated the review based on the fact that customer service reached out and sent a new speaker. I have received the new speaker and have tested it briefly, so far so good. I hope it holds up.We really wanted to love this speaker as we were using it for watching movies outside, however after a month or so, the speaker stopped being useful as it just drops the Bluetooth. We have tested the computer that we use with the older speaker we have, no issues. Than we connect this speaker and sure enough after 5-10min Bluetooth connection gets lost. With that said, when it worked, speaker was very clear and nice.. but now it‚Äôs useless. In other words, I would not recommend this speaker because it doesn‚Äôt last, and for its price, you should at least get 1 year of usage and not 1 month. Hope this helps others to not waste their money on this product.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2023",AFTXAXMLW3L6C6RGKIKIQYTIMBWQ,True,10,Color: Black
RXLXA65OAQKG4,B0CZN6J824,3.0 out of 5 stars Was Very Happy Until it Stopped Allowing Charging,Jim Johnson,3,"I was pretty pleased with this little powerhouse at first. The sound is surprisingly good, and it's quite portable. The dual-bluetooth pairing is also interesting, though can sometimes result in unexpected hijacking of phone audio if someone unexpectedly turns it on and your phone is paired. All good though.Unfortunately, it started refusing to charge, only flashing a single white LED when plugged in. I've tried multiple chargers and nothing will take. It acts like it's charging, but even after 48 hours it still quickly gives a ""busy signal"" sound and powers itself off after you turn it on, which the internet tells me means the battery is too low.Fortunately the unit is somewhat reparable from what I've read. There are ifixit guides out there, and if you don't mind soldering you can relatively painlessly replace the battery. I might give that a try.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AHJCZOCBM4J4FMRQ2JES76SF5RNA,True,4,Color: Black

The sound is rich, has really good clarity and does not distort as the volume increases.It is easy to pair with our phone. This speaker responds just as it should when changing songs and volume levels. The bluetooth range is very large also. We like that our phone doesn't have to be super close to work properly. In addition it has a very long battery life.It is an added bonus to have it water resistant, with a carry strap we use to secure it when needed.
