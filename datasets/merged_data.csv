ROREMTZJIG72A,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Quantum Leap in Quality,Amazon Customer,5,"The Echo Studio is a quantum leap from any other speaker that Amazon has produced to date. Everything else sounds like a transistor radio in comparison. The sound separation is fantastic and you can actually feel the bass at higher volume levels.There a couple of issues, however. The vaunted 3D sound is a waste on anything other than the songs that are specifically set up for it. DO NOT use it as a default setting. The music that is not 3D will sound muddy and the vocals will be lost in the mix. However, if you turn it off, the music will immediately brighten and the vocals will be clear and crisp. There are a lot of online reviews where they claim that the clarity of the vocals is lacking. That is because they were early reviews and took place before you could turn off the Spatial enhancement option. Second, if you combine the speaker in a group or as stereo pair, playing the amazon music app causes songs to stop playing at random and skip to the next song. I have read online where it stops playing altogether for some people. It does not happen when just playing though a single speaker. I have not experienced the problem, as yet, when playing through the alexa app. However the Alexa app navigation leaves something to be desired. Also the Alexa app doesn’t show the quality of the track that’s playing.Ok, issues out of the way, I have 2 of the Echo Studio paired for stereo and the sound is a revelation. Listening to the White Album in Ultra HD reveals melodies and instrumentation that I’ve never heard before. The clarity of the voices is amazing. It’s like listening to it for the first time. The 3D tracks sound great as well. There is a massive sound stage. The music really does envelop you. It’s not the same as surround sound. So those looking to relive the days of 5.1 SACD and DVD-HD will be disappointed. It’s impossible to get the same effect from one or two speakers. You won’t hear discrete sounds from behind you, but instead you get a full range from in front of you. It’s difference between sitting the front row for a concert (Echo Studio) and sitting on stage in the middle of the orchestra (5.1 surround). I haven’t tried out the pair for fireTV as yet. The current options for Dolby Atmos are limited and I’ve already watched the new season of Jack Ryan, but I may try this at some point in the future.The amazon credit for turning in an old Echo, sealed the deal on getting the second Studio. The wait for a second one was too long from Amazon, so I got it at Best Buy. They also participate in the Echo buy back program. So, I turned in an old echo dot and got 25% off the new studio (the discount is the same regardless of which echo you turn in), along with a $5 credit. So instead of $219 (with tax), I got the second studio for $155 (with tax). Great deal and with the discount it’s about the same price as an Echo Plus.The size may be an issue to some, but it wasn’t with me. In order to accommodate 5 speakers, there is no way for it fit into the same space as the Plus. The space is really need to fit the subwoofer and it certainly makes a difference.So my final thoughts: It’s a fantastic speaker. Much better than anything else you can get from Amazon. The price is right, especially if you turn in old echo dot (any echo really, but the dot is the cheapest of the bunch and you get the same discount). Don’t use the Stereo Spatial Enhancement. The songs in 3D will play that way regardless of the setting and it makes everything else sound worse (in my opinion). There may be point when Amazon releases an update to fix this, but at this point it’s worthless. I have never had a Bose or a Sonos, so I can’t compare, but I doubt anything in this price range can compete with what the Studio has to offer. If sound quality is important to you and you subscribe the Amazon HD music service (the studio is the only device Amazon offers that can play the Ultra HD music in full 24/196 quality), I would say run don’t walk to get one (or two) of these. You won’t regret it.UPDATE: I did try out the Dolby Atmos feature last night. I watched some of Jack Ryan and Carnival Row. The effect was just as outstanding as the music. Wide sound stage and clear, crisp dialogue. I do think that for watching movies the subwoofer might be a good addition. The bass was definitely present, but I think that the subwoofer would add some welcome bottom to the sound field (Perhaps that will be a Black Friday/Christmas purchase). The setup was fairly simple after restarting the 4K firestick. Initially the firestick was greyed out in the Alexa app, but after a restart it showed up. Set up involved just following the instructions after that.As stated before, there are very few options to watch Dolby atmos enabled content on Amazon. It does not allow it from Netflix, and as of yet, does not have the option for the Disney+. Hopefully that will change at some point in the near future (although I’m not holding my breath). However, since my main reason for buying the Studio in the first place was for music playback, I see the Atmos option as an added bonus.Update 2: they have fixed spatial enhancement mode! It sounds fantastic. If you toggle between the two modes, you can actually hear the sound field shrink. It's now very worthwhile. Also I added a sub to the mix and it does wonders for the sound. If you are using the studio in the kitchen or a home office, one will work spectacularly. If you are using it in a living room or large space then 2 with a sub is the way to go. The sub adds so much depth when you are listening in a larger space. Currently playing through the app is a problem but voice commands still work fine.","Reviewed in the United States November 19, 2019",AGV3Y7AA7N2IEGE4QIZB74GLEFQA,True,279,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R3IMWWB3T99A7F,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars These must be paired in stereo!,Steve Pugliese,5,"There will be plenty of reviews for the Studio in stand alone, single speaker use. It does sound excellent that way. But if you pair two Studios and throw in the Echo Sub, that is an extraordinary composition! That is the way to do the Echo Studio! That is how I'll review it here.I decided I must pair two Studios since I had two Echo Plus's stereo paired with an Echo Sub and it sounded pretty darn good. So I had to try the Studio paired in stereo, and since I had the Sub, I threw that in too. What else am I going to do with it? The Sub added a lot to the two Plus's. I wondered would you even notice it with the two Studios? I'm here to say that you definitely notice it. You notice it's not there, I can tell you.The sound of this whole system (two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) is quite exceptional. I would have to say it's thrilling! Yes, it costs $530 but that is bound to come down and did I tell you that it sounds incredible? It commands a respect, it really does. There is such a depth to this. The bass is deliberate and authoritative. Very punchy. It has exceptional dynamic range (at high volumes this can be startling) and the stereo image is just stunning. An enormous stage. Those 6 midrange speakers sound sweet indeed. Be sure to turn everything up in the equalizer in Audio Settings of the device in the Alexa App. This thing likes loud! It can easily handle max volume for extensive listening.You crank this up to ten and it literally takes over the room. If you can listen at that volume for awhile with this system (you must live without neighbors) you will be found with a huge smile on your face.All of Amazon's music library is now available in lossless CD quality streaming or better, which shines on this. The new celebrated 3D formats also sound excellent, though I thought there'd be more to them (Abbey Road sounded great but I didn't think it was transformed). But anything you play on this will sound exceptional. I really can't believe Amazon has taken it this far from the original Echo. Bravo! I notice that the Apple Homepod is now down to $200 at Best Buy. Would two of them paired sound better than this setup? I truly doubt it. They'd need a subwoofer and none, as far as I know, are available for it.A few things. The circling Alexa lights are now on top of the speaker. You can no longer really see them from the side, which is unfortunate. I love those lights! And two, the Studio comes with this ""spatial"" setting set. I recommend turning it off. In the Alexa app, go to the device and then Audio Settings and below the equalizer is that on off button for the spatial effect. I don't find it adds anything even though it really changes the acoustics. But if you want to hear music as it was recorded, leave this off.Oh, and I have to say that Amazon still does not make it super easy to set this all up. You have to start with a new or deregistered speaker. Set up each separately and then pair them. But it's anything but obvious or close to foolproof. Come on, Amazon!And I feel I must tell you that you can't connect to the Studio by Bluetooth when stereo paired. It will only play through one Studio, the first one you set up. To use the Studios in stereo pair with the Echo Sub, you can only stream. And you can only stream if you pay.Finally, then, these things are big. Really quite large. And seemingly only available now in black, though there's a gray one in Amazon's web site ads. This is not a speaker that sits demurely upon a table. It's almost as big as the Echo Sub, if that helps visualize it. But you will definitely be challenged as to its home, because that is where this will stay, like forever. Especially if you go for the whole magilla. But I urge you to at least try it (the whole magilla!). But be prepared, I guarantee you won't send them back!UPDATE: After a software update, the Spatial effect is now the preferred way, so leave it on. Turning it off now makes the music too flat. I think it may even turn off one of the mid range speakers. But something's missing!ADDENDUM:After two years, these still shine as brightly as ever. But the thing that must be emphasized is that this system of two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub is designed to take full advantage of Amazon Music’s HD streaming service, since these can work together only with streamed audio. Using that enables you to get at least CD quality audio recorded in lossless FLAC files (what Amazon calls HD, 16-bit/44.1kHz) for everything in the catalog, and Ultra HD (up to 24-bit/192kHz) available on an ever-growing list of recordings. In addition, it is also capable of playing Amazon’s (admittedly still in limited quantity) so called 3D Audio recordings (Amazon Music supports Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Reality Audio spatial audio formats). If you don’t get the Amazon Music HD package ($12.99 monthly with Prime / $14.99 without), then you will be missing out on what these speakers are designed to deliver. Amazon’s Ultra HD music must be heard on a system that supports it to be appreciated. It truly is something else in audio quality, significantly better sounding than any CD or LP. And Amazon Music’s catalog is growing by leaps and bounds every month. It is currently quite vast, even its Classical Music selection which has exploded in the two years since the Echo Studio was introduced.Using the Amazon Echo Link ($140), you could get this same quality streaming audio (or even better depending on your amp and speakers) for an existing Hi-Fi setup (at least I think you can- there seems to be some confusion about whether it supports the full 24-bit/192kHz Ultra HD), although you could not get 3D Audio with the Link. You could also use the Echo Link to attach any other sub-woofer to your Echo Studio pair but that would also require an additional amplifier thrown in. However, if you don’t have that Hi-Fi system already, these (2 paired Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) are the way to go to take full advantage of Amazon Music HD at a very favorable price. Just compare their cost to that of a good Hi-Fi system consisting of amplifier, pre-amp, two speakers and a sub-woofer as well as the Echo Link you’d need. The Echo speakers here are a definite bargain for getting excellent audio with minimal wires or fuss!","Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2019",AFO4QU7DSPYI65HOW4WNG667TPYA,True,2116,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R3B7CJ425Z8UZM,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Smart Speaker,jarreeddd,5,"Amazon really came through with this product. A few things to take into consideration:Sound Quality:While the sound quality is extremely good, especially given the price range, it’s definitely not on the top of the audiophile list. That being said, for the average person, this is a great speaker. It lacks luster in the mids so lyrics themselves aren’t as crisp as other high fidelity speakers on the market. However, the bass is awesome. No distortion. Also, this thing gets LOUD. Great for a house party or if you feel like rocking out.Alexa:While this may not be the BEST speaker out there, the Alexa integration and capability is great. The mics will pick up your voice from across the room even with music blasting. If you’re a heavy Alexa user then the great sound quality and seamless Alexa integration makes this the speaker for you. I personally run all my smart home devices through Alexa so having one more assistant in the room is great.Size:This speaker is chubby. Kind of looks like a chopped off robot head. It will definitely not just blend in the background. I have it on the corner of my desk 60x30 and still have plenty of room multiple screens and peripherals.Room adaptation:This speaker will definitely fool the room with sound. As far as the “3D Sound goes”, it’s really going to depend on the placement and structure of the room. If you place this in the corner of a room and try to listen to it from the opposite corner, you do loose some of that full sound effect. Also, the size and material of your room are going to effect the acoustics and how the sound bounces off the walls. It seems you really only get that full 3D sound effect if it’s directly in front of you and you have 4 solid walls for the sound to bounce off of. I have mine on the corner of the desk with the front speaker facing me. When I’m sitting at my desk I really get the full 3D effect. To manually reset/calibrate to a room hold down the command button for about 15 seconds.3D MUSIC:This speaker performs optimally when playing 3D Music from Amazon. Something to keep in mind though is that there are only about 1,000+ 3D song a offered. Who knows what the future has in store but that shouldn’t be the selling point if you’re looking at this speaker. Either way, you’re still getting great sound from any music app.Built in Zigbee:I don’t use any zigbee devices so I can’t comment on this. I also couldn’t figure out how it really works.Competition:For the same prize you could purchase a smaller Sonos One. Which one has better sound quality is up for debate but what’s lacking in the Sonos is Bluetooth connectivity. Also, the built in Alexa is limited.Using it as a sound bar:I personally only use this for listening to music while I’m at my desk. I can’t really see this being better than a a bar and subwoofer around the same price range or even slightly more expensive. I think it would work great with two Studio’s but then again ... there might be better options at that price range. User preference.Summary:I truly am impressed with this speaker and really enjoy using it. If you’re a casual music listener Like me and currently or plan to utilize Alexa, this is a great speaker. If you really want to fill the room then I would consider buying two and strategically placing them somewhere in the desired room.","Reviewed in the United States July 6, 2020",AH2KSTCMUKZIS5OUL5V66X3MRUTQ,True,27,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R3ICPDHKJYUHPV,B07G9Y3ZMC,"4.0 out of 5 stars A sweet-sounding, self-contained hi-fi smart speaker system that will both delight and frustrate you",Cam,4,"TL;DR for the Echo Studio is that the speaker, whether paired with the Echo Sub or not, running hi-fi music (I’m on Amazon HD) sounds fantastic, but there are so many glitches with it that I’m hard pressed to give it a full recommendation.I love music, but don’t consider myself an audiophile. I’m a family man and don’t have the luxury of a dedicated “listening room,” and I’m certainly not going to spend thousands on a home sound system. I like listening to music while having my morning tea, relaxing in my bedroom, and when in my car. I have so far been using a pair of Sony XB-43 bluetooth speakers at home and they have been adequate.I decided to look at upgrade options when I went over to Amazon HD for my streaming service (I also tried Tidal, but that’s for another review). I wanted something convenient, plug & play, and as a parent, relatively childproof. Bluetooth was not an option, as one loses most of the hi-fi benefits over bluetooth. Enter the Echo Studio. I already have a few Echo Dots, Fire TV, and as mentioned, Amazon HD Music, so it seemed like a natural fit. It should be noted however, that although Alexa Cast only works with Amazon Music, you can stream music with the other major services, Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and others.So I bought an Echo Studio for the breakfast area where I have my tea, and where I had previously been moving a bluetooth speaker every morning. Setup was quick and painless and I was immediately impressed with the sound. It’s not a high-end home stereo system, but it’s the best single-unit speaker system I have ever had and heard. And it’s $200.I used the Alexa app to set the EQ, but you can simply tell Alexa to “increase bass” or “reduce treble” or make any other adjustments on the fly, mid-song or whenever you like. I see some reviewers complaining about the sound profile and wonder if they made EQ adjustments for their personal preferences or to suit the type of music being played.Impressed, I ordered a second Studio and an Echo Sub for my bedroom. Setup and pairing the Sub was equally simple. At first I thought the Sub was defective, or not set up correctly, because I could barely hear anything coming from it. Turns out that for me anyway, it needs to be at a certain volume and playing certain music for it to really be felt. But feel it you will, as the Sub makes the music fill the room in a way that the Studio by itself doesn’t. Make sure you put the Sub on the floor.The glitches started here, with the bedroom Studio. The music would randomly stop playing, whether during a playlist or simply when I had asked it to play music from a certain artist or genre. When I say that, I mean every single time I used it. Two or three songs and then nothing. Extremely frustrating. My wifi setup is solid, so I looked at suggestions online, and several people recommended putting your Studio on your 5GHz and cordoning it off there (everything else in the house on your 2.4GHz). I tried this, but it did not solve the problem (I ended up leaving the Studios on 2.4GHz and it has been the best option). I unplugged and went through setup on the Studio again and the problem, for the most part, seemed resolved. I took the opportunity to bump my internet tier up to improve my overall household speeds. The music on both my Studios will still stop playing occasionally though, for no apparent reason, with a strong internet connection. And they will go into “red ring” mode too, which is extremely frustrating.Fast forward to now. Sound quality is noticeably better than my bluetooth speakers, and I mean noticeably. I am hearing guitar strings and cymbal crashes on music that I don’t remember ever hearing before. I used my bluetooth speaker last night for a bit and it was painful. There is no way I can ever go back to standard definition music streaming and bluetooth speakers. Think SD television versus HD television.Now for the drawbacks. These things are glitchy. Music will stop playing for no reason. Voice recognition of the music or the playlist you asked for is hit and miss. The Studio itself will go into “Sorry, I’m having trouble right now” mode (red ring mode) and won’t play any music for you. At all. For five minutes or for an hour. I have to remind myself that it is a somewhat data-intensive streaming service and think back to the earlier days of Netflix and the like.Also, while it is convenient to just tell Alexa what you want to listen to, at times I miss having the control of just playing music from my phone, and the Alexa casting is frustrating. Bring up the Amazon Music app, start playing your music (which you have to do before you get the casting button), wait for it to connect, then finally get the music going. Yes, it's probably only seven seconds, but trust me, it feels cumbersome. Again, even Netflix needs to load up.If you happen to use a voice command directly to the Studio while casting (because when casting, you lose the Alexa voice control function from your Amazon Music app) it reverts back to Alexa app control and you’re out of casting mode (and phone control). Even if you don’t, the casting drops after a bit and you have to go through the connection process again. I’m not going to pair the Studio over bluetooth to get phone control, if I wanted bluetooth quality sound I wouldn’t have bought the Studio. (I did pair it once to check it out, and the music was at a super low volume).It would be nice to be able to browse the music app and tap a song or playlist at any time and just have it play on the Studio as with a bluetooth connection. As it is, I have to tell Alexa to play it while I’m looking at music choices on the app and hope she gets it right. While on the Alexa app and controlling from there, sometimes it will show me the playlist I’m listening to, sometimes it doesn’t.I also have Apple Music, as other family members are on Apple Music, and other than one time at the outset, it will play the Apple Music when requested without any problems (Amazon Music is my default setting).As I sit writing this review, my Studio has played my music flawlessly the entire time and sounds fantastic, and this is what keeps me in the Echo Studio game and considering a third Studio to stereo pair in the bedroom with the Echo Sub (Prime Days?). If it performed this way consistently and the Alexa and Amazon Music apps integrated more smoothly, I would give the Echo Studio a 100% recommendation. I am holding out hope that future software updates will smooth out the rough edges. Until then, know what you’re getting. A sweet-sounding, self-contained hi-fi smart speaker system that will both delight and frustrate you.","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2021",AGZKEU6775IB7BPUFQXEQ32UPSUA,True,464,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R2UDHP4SHVFE9T,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Solid Performance in a Unique Product,Clinton W. Salvato,5,"I had been looking at, and watching reviews of the Echo Studio since it was announced last year, and had decided, it was a product, that I initially wanted to get my hands on, and at least test.Since I have been happy with my Echo Plus 2nd Gen, and Echo Dot 3rd Gen, I put the studio on the back burner.Earlier this month, I just happened to be at my local Best Buy, and they had a couple in stock, so I decided to grab one.First Impressions:The studio looks and feels to be well builtIt seems to be able to fit into a good amount of places, although I've only had it in one so far, but (judging by that location) leads me to believe, even though the largest echo speaker, that it can fit anywhere (within reason).The sound is extremely well balanced, at least for the majority of music I listen to, and even a good stereo mix is immersive on this speaker, the left and right channels come out clear, and it's NOT just stereo, it does immerse you, however, I have noticed that it depends on the style and recording quality of the music as to how well that works. As others have mentioned in reviews, by default the Echo Studio has a Spacial feature enabled to enhance stereo. I'll leave this up to YOU to turn it off, or leave it on. I will leave this suggestion, if you don't have a technical background in audio, and want to keep things simple turn this off in the Alexa app under settings:device settings: your echo studio:audio settings. I say this because it's essentially what Dolby Pro Logic, and other similar technologies do to simulate surround sound from stereo. Some music it actually helps and gives a nice affect to, and others it distorts, and actually makes sound worse. Putting that aside though Audio sounds really good through this device, and the bottom line is, to get the best performance, you can't always use the defaults, or someone else's settings, because there are too many variables. that can change.Other things I've found to share, Initially I had WiFi issues with the 5ghz channel, because the Echo doesn't get full signal where it's at here, but switching to the 2.4ghz channel has made things more stable, not just for the echo studio, but features like multi room music, and overall performance. My advice here is:Yes, 2.4ghz is going to be a slower channel then the 5Ghz one in many cases. However, for an audio only device such as an echo without a screen, it's not going t make a difference in performance. So if issues with Wifi, and it's on the 5ghz channel, try setting it to 2.4. Amazon even recommends this, in their help article on updating and troubleshooting Wifi settings with echo products. Let me rephrase that, they suggest 5ghz for faster performance but suggest 2.4 for better stability and signal range.Bottom Line:The echo studio is a great smart speaker with a unique design and purpose. As always, while the sound is great from this device, it's not a replacement for a dedicated surround system. If you're ok with this fact, and still want to try this product, I recommend it 100%.","Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2020",AHFCEVZCWVGXS6AMGVQCAM7I7NBQ,True,16,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R1HM75FHMPH5NT,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Two Echo Studios in stereo mode sounds exponentially better than one,REM52,5,"(Note: This was written by me and posted elsewhere, so ignore the personal references – I have simply pasted it here so that I didn’t have to write it again!) Two regular Echo speakers paired in stereo mode don't even come close to the ear-pleasing sound that comes from two Echo Studios in stereo mode. As you said, Ty, you listened to only one Studio speaker, and some of that listening was in a surround mode. The Echo Studio does not ""shine"" with just one Studio (when playing regular stereo music files, which are the most common). Two of them paired in stereo mode sound exponentially better. I humbly ask you to reconsider your 7 rating for sound quality and change it to 9 or 10, for the benefit of potential buyers interested in purchasing high quality equipment. If using two Echo Studios in stereo mode, turn off the ""Upmixing"" toggle switch in the Alexa app. Upmixing tries to adapt 2-channel stereo music to the 3D potential of the Studio. If you don't turn off upmixing, the sound will not be that clear and direct, and you will get the wrong impression about how good these speakers really are. That is why some reviewers gave the Echo Studio a low rating when it first came out because you could not turn off the “upmixing” (Stereo Spatial Enhancement) feature, but now you can. With that feature turned on, the speaker will try to add some processing to the sound and that doesn't sound very good in stereo mode with two Studios. That processing may sound ok with one Studio, but even then it's hit-and-miss, depending on which song is playing. Up-mixing is not perfect and not best for all songs.Comparison of the Echo Studio to the Regular Echo:The regular $99 Echo has drivers (internal speaker units) whose sound gets somewhat trapped inside the enclosure case, as the separate woofer and tweeter drivers face each other with a small space between them (they point down and up, not out -- one pointing at the other!) instead of facing outwardly like the Echo Studio’s drivers. But the 3 midrange drivers and one tweeter inside each Echo Studio are facing outward and project the sound outside of the enclosure. That makes a big difference -- there's much more clarity and presence in the midrange and treble. It does not get muffled or trapped inside the enclosure at all; it is allowed to come out clearly and completely. I am hearing detail in songs I’ve been playing for decades -- details I’ve never heard before. Those details are clear as can be without being harsh or grating to the ears. The outward facing circular arrangement of the midrange and tweeter array act like sort of a wide-dispersion tweeter – no matter where you are standing you hear each speaker channel’s sound very clearly (ideal for when you are moving around, working in the kitchen, etc. And I am talking about stereo mode here, not a surround mode). The bass is clear and mostly tight – just right without overdoing it. And if you listen to talk radio on these, the sound (EQ) automatically adjusts itself so that the talker's voice doesn’t sound boomy (those built-in monitoring microphones work well).Finally, it is recommended to adjust the EQ settings using the Alexa app, and set the EQ to: Bass middle (5 on the scale), Midrange boosted to about 6 or 7 out of 10, and Treble to about 8 out of 10 (this sounds best in the very small alcove that I have these speakers set up in). Use a good-sounding music file for test listening – an audio file that has never been compressed more than once, and has been encoded well, and been recorded in high quality (not necessarily a hi-res file). An excellent sounding sample to buy and use for testing purposes is Rudolf from Burl Ives’ album “Have a Holly Jolly Christmas”. Sure, it’s an old-fashioned song but it is extremely well-recorded and encoded (at least on the specific album I mentioned). You can purchase it for 99 cents on Amazon’s online digital music store if you want to have it stored in the cloud and playable on demand -- on these speakers.Note about Setup: if you have a weak Wi-Fi signal, the slow signal from your Wi-Fi router may cause some confusing delays during setup, so if you encounter this, begin by finding a way to get an adequate signal strength to these excellent speakers. Move your router closer or maybe buy a Wi-Fi extender if your Wi-Fi signal is weak in the spot where the two Studios are located. After a minute or so of getting established, they will find their way to sync with each other and play in perfect, flawless stereo without you having to do anything after the setup.

R2R3BT8Q353VJ9,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Better than HomePod and Sonos One,Sucram,5,"UPDATEI’ve had the 2.1 setup connected to a 4K Stick for 5 months, which has been used as a sound bar/stereo in our master bedroom. From a music perspective, it sounds it’s pretty good! The sound stage is full and produces decent bass. I wish it got a little louder. I find the bass response better for music than movies (I LOVE heavy bass in action scenes). If you like heavy bass for action movies, you may be a little disappointed. .I have, but no longer experience the connectivity issues others have written about. Mine were limited to music playback, however the issue subsided a few months ago.I’ll address three improvement areas:1) When connected with the sub, all the lows go through the sub and the woofers on the studios are rendered useless, unless the volume is high. The trade-off is clearer sound than when the studios are paired alone. Personally, I look at it as a design flaw. All three units should produce lows (or at least have the settings in the EQ to do so) for a better, more immersive bass experience. What good is a 5.25’ Studio driver if it won’t be used when paired?? 🤔2) As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a lip syncing issue when used as a home theater. Depending on the source the fire stick is decoding, there can be a noticeable sound lag. I have not discovered a way to address this issue.3) The Studios have the ability to play lossless tracks (24bit). However, paired with a Fire device (Cube, 4K stick... doesn’t matter) the output drops to 16bit, because the sound is decoded in the Fire device and played through the Studio. This simply means that fidelity/musical clarity is lost . The limitation lies within the Fire device, not the Studio. However, it’s worth mentioning because when connected to a Fire device, the Studios will be limited to the capability of the decoding device. If they’re used as a stand-alone stereo for music only, you can use the Studios to their full ability.BOTTOM LINEI like the setup. I already owned the Eco Sub so its cost had no bearing on my buying decision. The Studios were an add-on for me. In fairness, I came out off of pocket $240 for both Studios combined. With that said, FOR ME I find great value and functionality.The question is, if I was to start over and pay full retail ($400 for two Studios + $130 for the sub) for a wireless stereo/sound bar system, what would I think? Could I find a better wireless Atmos Sound bar + woofer with no lip syncing issues for the money? YEP! Could I find a better wireless Smart stereo for the money? I’m not so sure! Could I find one that does both pretty well? I doubt it! Could I split the money between two decent systems, one for music and one for theater? Not why would I go do that??? I’d get one that could do multiple things.FOR THE MONEY it’s good buy. It’s not a Sonos Playbar + Sub (which is 2x the cost) nor a B&W sound bar & Sub (which is 4x the cost). It’s good for the money.If you can look past the intermittent lip sync issue, go for it. If that's a deal breaker, spend more and get a sound bar that also produces good music.————————————————————The speakers sounds great! No complaints; simple setup, quick calibration and I was off to the races.From a price point, it's comparable to the Sonos One. From a sound quality, it far exceeds. Sonos One is probably slightly clearer, but that's where the comparisons stop. Echo Studio has a wider/fuller sound stage, more bass, gets louder. The closest comparison is probably the HomePod or Play 3. IMO, this sounds better than both.I already own an Echo Sub and ordered an additional Studio for pairing. I have yet to connect to FireTV 4k to test the home theater setting.In summary, this produces very good sound, the price is reasonable and it's the best smart speaker on the market... in my humble opinion...","Reviewed in the United States November 20, 2019",AESCZXYRRCQIGJENUJNOCLABQLEQ,True,69,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R23FTPV6XGQSBX,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Multi-Player Music issue solved,CafeSociety,5,"Alexa Echo SpeakersMulti-room Music issuesI found a solution to not being able to get more than one speaker to work at a time, paired, or set up a “Multi-Room Music” in the Alexa app. This solution also fixed my inability to get Apple enabled devices connected into HomeKit, or even Google Nest Hubs to set up, period.Quick answer: Deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation” when activating your 2.4 Wi-Fi broadcast on your router.I also took all speakers off guest wifi. But I’ll try to put them back to see if that is necessary now.Back story: Months of issues with HomeKit, (only weeks with Echo Multi-Room Music), I gave up trying and decided to try Alexa and Google to replace my Apple smart home efforts. I spent way too much time. After the fix, I’ll live a blended tech life. I’ll give a quick answer, followed by my backstory: Last week I was at my wits end in utter frustration over three major roadblocks. I acquiesced and decided to try Alexa because I couldn’t get almost any of my Apple HomeKit enabled devices into HomeKit, except for new Apple products. I knew it had to be something small I was missing. Alexa was sooooo easy and quick to connect to everything, before I figured out the fix. (I dislike the echo show advertising, their echo speakers are better.) While they seemed a breeze to connect everything, for some reason I couldn’t get more than one echo speaker to work at a time. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room Music or even connect a pair to play together. Hundreds of tries. I deleted, reset, rebooted, spent over 4 hours with Comcast yesterday (thankfully a Boston native who did not put me on hold every minute like certain countries) getting my internet working again. I had rebooted my modem and router so many times, my computer got molasses slow and I feared I went too farIn interest I also decided to try a few Google nest hub speakers. Black Friday had great sales on all this stuff. Trying to set up googles hub 7 was impossible. It wouldn’t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before “Something went wrong” message. Probably over 70 tries. (Google is better than Echo Show. Apple HomePod mini sounds crisper and better than Amazon echo 4 and mini 5’s. But Alexa is way friendlier to interact with verbally, and price point, well...)Frustration. Thursday, I broke down and bought my first Apple Homepod Mini to see if I can get that working and see if it works better than the Apple TV 4k Ethernet connection. The HomePod mini gave me a hint how to solve all these l connection and internet blocks. The HomePod mini kept telling me that I don’t have “peer-to-peer connection” allowed on my network.Now, I’m a little techy, but it took three days (ehem, months) to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It’s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast.I had to deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation.”That was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months, ..year.For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this particular router setting, so I thought I’d share with ppl. Tonight, I finally am able to simultaneously play music on all of my Echo speakers, connect my HomeKit enabled and Google nest hubs.I’m not sure what this will do for my/your internet security. But I’m going with it for now. And I’ll try to put all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi. I’ll never really leave Apple, but after interacting with other smart speakers, it’s probably not going to be my main go to for speaker or answers to questions. Or I’ll just get too creeped out by Google and Amazon invasiveness and acquiesce with Apple instead. Echo Dot 5 (this is such a sprite, great speaker!)Echo 4are my favorite for Amazon EchoEcho Studioseems the least smart, most deaf, quiet, combative, difficult to interact with, of the three speakers. Hopefully the Multi-Room music fix will improve my experience with itEcho Show 8Meh. Far too much and annoying advertising of non-solicited or wanted advertisements. Least user friendly screen to work with. It sits unplugged for the most part. I mostly got this for a friend who visits who wants a YouTube fireplace playing on the tv.SIDE NOTE on other Smart Home Amazon (online, or physical store) products, related to this topic:I have been pleased with Smartbot plugs, switches and app, the Levoit 600s air purifiers and app (app goes by VeSync), and Lutron Caséta Light Switches and Dimmers, and hub. Lutron has the most stable and reliable app out there. I was fine running their apps separately. They are very nice, better than the big 3 apps. Well, back to listening to music throughout my house instead of one or two rooms. Joy!","Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2023",AET2S5FABMJZMJRPX2DPLTYNWXDQ,True,18,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R3GJ6M7II6KROT,B07G9Y3ZMC,"5.0 out of 5 stars Really Worthwhile Upgrade from ""Echo 3rd gen Smart Speaker""",Andy San Diego,5,"I've had the ""Echo 3rd gen Smart Speaker"" for 4 years, and am surprised to see it cost $99, close to the $150 I just (July 2024) paid for the subject Echo Studio (refurbished). What a big upgrade! But not to be compared with a big hi fi speaker set-up I used to have, Harman Kardon. In Ravel's Bolero, the big crash at the peak of the crescendo would actually stop my heart. I'm trying that now on the Echo Studio, but I'm sure it won't even break any glass.Adding this edit a few days later. The companion Echo Subwoofer will arrive today. I can't wait to see what it will add. I am optimistic. I note that the Studio delivers that special sound of Italian tenors, one I can stand for only a few minutes at a time. The point I was trying to make in my original review is that the Studio does not give out that brilliant lifelike large cymbal-like deafening crash you get with a true hi fi LP player/tuner/cabinet speakers. But, coupled with Amazon Music, the Studio, hopefully augmented by the Subwoofer, is highly pleasurable. I'll update this after I try the Sub. The performance of Bolero that Alexa came up with is not the performance I had on LP with the big speakers, so that is also a factor.Edit August 5, 2024: First, regarding the Sub, I was not able to get it going even with about an hour on the phone with Amazon Customer Service. I couldn't pair the Sub with the Studio, and had to return it. However, I picked up the tip from another review that Alexa will increase or decrease the Studio's treble and bass. I said twice, ""Alexa, turn up the bass."" And today I asked her to play J.S. Bach. Many of his compositions include solos by viola or cello, and I find the Studio's bass satisfactory. For comparison, I reset the Studio to its original settings (hold the mic button and the volume down button for 20 seconds) and I couldn't hear any difference in the bass. Both settings sound fine.August 8, 2024 To reinforce my favorable opinion. I just listened to the entire Sibelius violin concerto with Hilary Hahn and my morning coffee, no distractions, and enjoyed it so much. My favorite piece so far.Today will try pairing my ""Echo 3rd gen Smart Speaker"" in another part of this room, both about 20 feet from where I sit.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2024",AEPTDB7BAXKDQQOI2QMHCNV6JHBA,True,1,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R3HYR9LHISIGJ8,B07G9Y3ZMC,3.0 out of 5 stars Audio Issues when configured as home theater,Dean,3,"This journey got started when Amazon recently announced their newly upgraded music service, Amazon Music HD.For an audiophile, musician and music lover such as myself, this announcement was the holy grail of music. Amazon claimed you can now access millions of tracks in lossless hi resolution audio quality. But let m clear on what this really means to avoid confusion. Typical streaming services such as Spotify stream with audio quality that is sub-par to audio CD's. Amazon's new service boasts both HD audio and Ultra HD audio. When you pull up a track on the service, it designates whether it is an HD audio track, or an Ultra HD audio track. An HD audio track is CD quality, with a bit rate of 16 bits and a sampling rate from 44.1khz to 48kkhz. While many marketers tout this as lossless, it's not really lossless, but it is a big improvement over standard streaming. On the other hand, true lossless is what Ultra HD audio is all about. True lossless Ultra Audio tracks must have a bit rate of 24 bits, and a sample rate that can go as high as 192k. These are true hi-resolution audio tracks that are much better sounding than HD tracks. I was an early adopter of the now defunct DVD-Audio/SACD formats, which were true 24 bit hi-res audio, so I immediately upgraded to the new Amazon Music HD service, excited to have such a vast library of hi-res audio tracks now at my disposal.I had recently downsized my home, so didn't have the room anymore for a true 5.1 discreet surround system anymore. I'v been using a soundbar and wasn't happy. So when Amazon introduced the Echo Studio, I took notice. After researching, I learned that the Echo Studio supports 24 bit audio, meaning it has the ability to play Ultra HD tracks. So it was time to update my audio system. I went to Best Buy the first day the Studios went on sale there, and invested in 2 Echo Studios and an Echo Sub.In the Alexa app, you can configure these components for a home theater environment and that was my plan. I had also already owned a Fire TV Cube, which was great for streaming my content and controlling my home theater devices using voice commands. I upgraded my Fire TV Cube to gen 2 in anticipation of integrating it with my Echo Studios and Sub.If you want Dolby Atmos soundtracks when watching movies, you need to have the Fire TV/Fire TV Cube in the mix, as the Fire TV performs the audio decoding for these surround modes. Through the Alexa app, it was relatively easy to configure the Fire TV Cube, configure each Echo Studio for left and right channel, and the sub. That is my Home Theater Group.Now this is where things begin to derail. I said to Alexa ""Play Jack Ryan"", and I was immediately impressed with the sound emanating from the 2 Studios and the Sub. It did a great job decoding the Dolby Atmos soundtrack, and short of a true discreet surround setup, I was quite impressed. Center dialog came through nicely, soundtrack effects were presented on a nice wide soundstage, giving a nice surround illusion without actual rear speakers.Next up, the moment I've been waiting for. Time to listen to some 24 bit hi res audio. Through the Amazon Music HD app in the Fire TV Cube, I searched for some Ultra HD tracks. Again the tracks are designated as HD or Ultra HD. I decided to play The Sound of Silence by Disturbed, which was marked as Ultra HD. ""Alexa, play the Sound of Silence by Disturbed"". Oddly, the song started playing, but it took about 5 seconds for the audio to actually kick in, cutting of the beginning of the song. The other thing I noticed was when I used the voice command, it pulled up the standard HD version of the track. I knew there was an Ultra HD version, as I had just looked for it. So I did a manual search, found the Ultra HD version and started playing it. Oddly, it sounded no different from the other version to me. The label on the screen said Ultra HD now, so this was odd. I clicked on the track information, and was surprised to learn that even though the screen label for the track is Ultra HD, the song was actually streaming at 16 bit, 44.1k audio. This is not hi-res Ultra HD at all. Any laymen would look at the screen and think they're streaming in Ultra HD because it says it's an Ultra HD track, but the track information was telling a different story.This is where the call to tech support happened. Tech support sent some logs to the development team and them got back to me. What he tried to tell me at first, was that I was indeed listening to 24 bit audio through the Studios. How can that be possible when I'm actively streaming and it clearly says 16 bit, 44.1k. It didn't make any sense to me. Once you have the Cube integrated with the Studios, the voice interaction is between you and the Cube, not you and the Studios. Further, if you need the Cube to decode the Dolby Atmos soundtrack, then it stands to reason that the audio decoding is taking place in the Cube, not the Studios. That was my argument to the tech support guy, and he agreed that made sense. So...I've come to find out that the Cube is only capable of 16 bit audio output, not 24 bit. So the Cube is sending the audio to the Studios in lower resolution, not taking advantage of either the Ultra HD tracks in Amazon Music, or the capabilities of the Studio's hi-res audio capabilities.So I cannot natively, in my home theater setup, issue a voice command and have Alexa play back an Ultra HD music file through the Echo Studio speakers. This was a huge let down, especially after making all this investment. But I still had one more test. If I bypass the Cube, and use the Amazon Music app in my iPhone to cast directly to the Studios, then this should give me Ultra HD audio in all its glory. I'm doing this for testing purposes only. I should have to, nor would I want to, whip out my phone in my home theater to play Ultra HD tracks. I should simply be able to issue a voice command to my home theater components, and the Amazon Music app in my home theater system should be doing it for me.The cool thing about the mobile app version though, is when you click on the HD or Ultra HD icon, it displays the full resolution of the track, the bit and sample rates of the equipment it's connected to, and the actual resolution being played. SO now I can validate the bit rate and sampling rate going from my iPhone Amazon Music app directly to the Echo Studios. Only I can't. When I press the Ultra HD icon I get a message that says ""Information not available when casting""! What?? So I can see this info on all my other playback devices such as my car entertainment system, my headphones, but not the Studios? So I still have no idea what the actual nit and sampling rates are bypassing the Cube.Amazon: You are touting the benefits of Ultra HD hi-res audio. You have created an audiophile speaker with the Echo Studio (supposedly) capable of playing 24 bit Ultra HD tracks. But there is no way for me to stream these Ultra HD tracks natively in my home theater, and no way for me to even validate the audio resolution from my phone direct to the Studios. So here I am with all this new equipment and still can't natively enjoy hi res audio through a simple voice command to either my Echo Studios or the Cube. Seems to me the fix would be a software update to make the Cube 24 bit. Please don't make me buy a third 24 bit Cube!","Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2019",AGH7VPPT7KTTVJ4YKF5KVHNAZ7HQ,True,331,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R4J20AT9WBXT1,B07G9Y3ZMC,"4.0 out of 5 stars Honest Review from a Sound Designer, Musician and Video Streaming Nut!",Erik,4,"These speakers are a great value for the money, easy to set up, sound great and overall just an awesome way to transform your home into a theatre like experience. In regards to the reviews from the audiophiles trashing the quality; they're just completely off for what these studios are meant for. Actual studio speakers are meant to sound flat for production purposes. A home entertainment system, unless you're going to pay crazy money, is meant to be loud, clear and not distort. These are great for music and streaming in a living room to give you that theatrical feel. If you want to install an actual theater in your house, then yes, go spend way more money on better speakers.The sounds is really impressive for the price point. I have studio monitors in my music studio that cost hundreds more per speaker, and what can I say? I'm just impressed with what they're delivering for the price.My current set up is a Fire TV Cube with 2 Echo Studio speakers. One placed on each side of the television for a true stereo experience.When listening at really low volumes, I double checked a few times to make sure the sound was coming from speakers because the stereo imaging really is that good. Dialogue centers right to the TV and the ambiance is great, not to mention the panning of sound effects from left to right (you'll feel it when you see that plane fly across screen, bullets fly from one side of the room not to mention movie scores sound great). The room analyzer really is fantastic and uses your walls to reflect sounds for a great experience.The speakers are balanced and my only recommendation for the EQ is to open up the Alexa App, throw your ""Highs"" all the way to the top (to the far right of the slider), your mids to the middle and give yourself just a little boost for the bass. Now we're talking! If you push your bass or mids too far it's going to sound muddy. Again, these aren't studio speakers and I think the EQ provided is more than sufficient.I've tried watching with just one speaker to see how it sounds. The speaker auto adjusts to the room and does give a convincing stereo feel to your experience, however, if you double the speaker, you double the power—this means you're gonna get way more punch and I can't recommend it enough. If you're on a budget or on the fence, just try one.Overall the sound is good, set up is easy and EQing them on the app is a breeze. So big checks for all of these things. Within 30 minutes (read about the delay below) I was re-watching favorite action and sci movies just to hear them in my living room and I was really impressed with the quality of the highs, mids and even the bass. I don't understand why one would invest in the Echo Sub — just get 2 Studio speakers and the combined power of them is going to give them all the ""UMMF"" you need. The woofer in these guys is plenty at higher volumes.In comparison to the apple home pods: As someone who almost exclusively uses apple products, I couldn't be happier with these. Apple is just charging way too much for their speakers for slightly better quality and they will sound not much better to the untrained ear. It's simply not worth the extra money.So why aren't these getting 5 stars? Well to be honest, I wasn't aware that they would only connect as a studio pair with Fire TV over wi-fi. Read that carefully. Yes, they still have a quarter inch in (like for your headphones on your phone) and they are blue tooth enabled, but in order to take advantage of using them in stereo they need to be connected over wifi and so does the sound source. Therefor, you aren't having a party and letting people just connect to the pair to play their music (unless it's one speaker at a time). Not a big deal if it's mainly for entertainment, but I do wish I would have known.In addition to that, one of my primary frustrations was purchasing the Fire TV Cube so we could easily stream 4k media without longer buffering or drop outs. Well, the way you do that is by connecting your Cube to your ethernet. Unfortunately, the stereo pair has to be connected to the Fire TV over Wifi, so that means the Cube has to be connected to wifi as well. They will NOT work for your cube/firestick if you're connected over ethernet. This was a bit frustrating and caused some minor hiccups in my setting up... so instead of 10 minutes it took me about 30 to delete and reinstall the pairs.So this leads me to my one BUYER BE WARE: if you are trying to stream 4k, make sure you have a good internet speed and if not you better have your modem nearby or you'll want to buy a wifi router to plug in to increase the signal near your TV, firestick or cube. In the end, I had a router next to where my TV was to extend our wifi throughout the house, but there's NO WAY everyone has this set up and I would have been really upset if I had major issues watching 4k. Luckily, I have not and I don't have super fast internet (about 55mbps) so I'm hoping most buyers are not put in that position.With that said, I do believe some of this could be fixed with a firmware or software update, so I'm hopeful. If they do, I'd change my review to 5 stars.Overall navigating and using Alexa is what it is and there's plenty of reviews about that elsewhere. One thing to note: if you have the cube and 2 speakers, they do not overlap well when listening for voices. I highly recommend you mute 2 of them (I muted one speaker and the cube with the microphone mute button on top of the unit) so we're only giving voice commands to one speaker.In summary, if you're looking to add theatre like quality sound and punch to your living room, you cannot go wrong with these guys.Make sure you have descent internet for streaming 4k (55mbps or higher) and don't be afraid to play around in the Alexa app to tweak your set up to your liking.Even as someone who lives and breathes audio, I was impressed. Not because they are the best sounding speakers but for what they deliver, how easy they do it and for what price they are doing it at.","Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2019",AECBER7U5OKNMVQB4R73KQH3MMAQ,True,231,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

The sound quality is terrific, but there's a lot of issues & bugs that need to be resolved and smoothed out from the integration of Alexa/Echo Studio and other devices.For example:1) Although I have navigation sounds turned on for my Omni FireTV, Echo either ignores that setting or turns it off. Doesn't matter how many times I turn it back on, it turns it off every time. Before I bought Echo, this issue didn't exist.2) The volume control on my FireTV is stepped from 1 to 100, yet on Echo it's stepped from 1-10. Why this inconsistency in volume control settings among Amazon products? So when I ask Alexa/Echo to change the volume, I only have a range of 1-10, instead of the finer resolution of the TV's 1-100.3) Echo has issues remaining connected to the wireless home network. My wireless router is only 20' feet away, yet it's a regular occurrence for Echo to lose the connection, then create its own ad-hoc network to reconnect. Then it's a PITA process that takes several tries to get Echo to reconnect to your preferred home network. My FireTV has no issues remaining connected to my wireless network and never disconnects or drops it. Why does Echo have this issue remaining connected, even when manually chosen in the Alex app?4) All the different color rings on Echo that mean different things makes you ignore them, because it's ridiculous trying to remember what all the different colors & pulses are supposed to mean when they light up. I ended up saving a PDF doc to my PC & phone that I open when I'm wondering what Echo is doing and flashing certain colors & behaviors. A simple solution would be a concise answer from Alexa if you ask her, 'Alexa...what are you doing?' If we're going to go full-boat on voice control AI, then do it properly & completely.5) Why does Alexa/Echo sometimes alert you to some notifications, but not others? Why do the alerts contain no info or only vague info? Why doesn't Alexa notify me when an Amazon package is delivered, although I have that setting? All these inconsistent/incomplete behaviors are annoying and useless.6) We need an Alexa app for the PC, instead of just the phone app, to control settings for the Echo and other Alexa devices. Please make one for the many who use PC's most of the time for home & work.There's other issues & bugs, but I can't remember them all now.Would I buy an Echo Studio again? Yes, because the sound is great and Alexa is handy to have for some things...but there's also numerous issues to resolve & improvements that need to be made to the Echo Studio & Alexa.","Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2024",AHJK3DQCO27M4MC6UHUTLWQECOMA,True,1,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

I bought it WITH the Alexa studio sub-woofer because I knew I want as 'full' as experience as possible.The old Echo Plus was displaced in my living room by the ""Studio"" and, although the whole set-up was more expensive than I would have liked, it's probably worth it! The sound is REALLY good and makes the Echo Plus (even though the Echo Plus was 'good') sound like a tin can with a string stretched to another tin can. Well, that may be extreme. But still, the Studio version just sounds GREAT! With classical music, the bass added by the sub-woofer is marvelous! To MY ears, there's so much bass in pop music anyway that the added bass seems barely worth it to me. But classical and jazz? Definitely worth it!The set up was really simple. (Getting the Echo Plus to work in another room - which had an Echo Dot in it previously - has so far been fruitless. Nothing I've done in the app or otherwise has succeeded and I hesitate calling Amazon support because (1) I have a phone phobia and (2) that phobia was caused by agonizing attempts at phone support elsewhere.If it's in your budget, the Alexa Studio and subwoofer are sort of 'game changers' in Alexa's world.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AFL5HZCRX7NJF6EE6IMP7KNI5WHA,True,1,Color: GlacierConfiguration: Device only

It has an unforgiving presence, hate it or love it, kinda feel. Not a deal breaker for me but for some people its a viable reason to pass on the Studio.Lets proceed, I am going to be honest, I tried my best to set the speaker up as a home theater system on my own going through the Alexa app. The first of many frustrations to come, I ended up having to factory reset it (deregister it) and call Amazon Alexa tech support to help me set it up. In my defense, I came from Homekit/ Siri/ Apple TV world where things are arguably a little more user friendly. The customer service/ tech support for Amazon Alexa services is outstanding. If I ever have to call them again for any issues, I feel confident that I will get my issue resolved over the phone. Alright so with the assistance of an Alexa technician guiding me through the process we were able to connect my Echo Studio to my Fire TV Cube. Thats what I wanted! It was a longer process than I wanted but I was finally there, probably took a couple hours to fiddle with it including the hold time and assistance over the phone. It is what it is, just a meh moment for me. But now I'm all set up and all is working.Then through out the night we proceed.Flood gates of frustration opens...Before I take a dump on the Echo Studio, let me reiterate when sound comes out of the speaker it sounds really good. Standalone Bluetooth speaker its number one. Its without a doubt should be on anyone's radar looking for one. With the flexibility of all the music streaming services, solid mids and highs and house rattling bass, it is definitely a contender in this space. Price and value alone to me its hands down the winner.Now lets talk about my deal breaking issues with the speaker.Amazon advertises the Echo Studio as a theater system that supports Dolby Atmos using their latest Fire TV Cube, I told you that earlier and thats what lead me down this path. But there are issues on the software side that needs to be addressed before this even gets close to a theater system replacement.Audio and video sync issues. Yes I know you are able to go into settings and tweak this, and so I did... various times throughout the night. It seemed like after awhile the audio and video sync would sway off and I would have to go back into the settings and tweak it again. A high frustration, but forgivable for the price. I could live with it and hope for updates to come with better syncing support. As long as nothing else was an issue I could deal with it, But I am now needing a flawless experience from here on out.Unfortunately, flawless is not in the Studio's vocabulary.Switching between Bluetooth music from my phone and theater system is an absolute nightmare and some how Amazon Music playing from the Fire Cube TV was thrown into the mix as well. Its like Freddy vs Jason, two nightmares into one. The studio can not handle and decide the proper channel to play the media without a little effort on the user end. Its hard to explain but juggling media playback for a theater system shouldn't have multiple sources; Bluetooth and Fire Cube TV that should be it. It seems like both devices are competing for attention, while the speaker should just be a speaker when connected to a fire cube.Side note, ""Alexa, Connect to my phone."" never worked. Studio also has a hard time handling more than one Bluetooth connected device. Had to manually connect my wife's and mine's device each and every time to play music. Also a couple times I had to restart the whole set up because music wasn't playing. Restarted the Fire Cube, Studio, and phone to get music playing. My frustration is building at this point.The final straw though was later that night while watching a show the audio without warning abruptly goes out. Video still playing but the Studio was silent. I was fed up. I wasn't going to bring something in my home that I had to babysit every night. I didn't even try to troubleshoot the issue. I did the final and last factory reset on the Studio and packaged the speaker back up to be returned.I know I am an edge case and I am being extremely critical on some functionality , but at the end of the day, I dont want to deal with any issues. I want to set it and forget it. Give me the same sound and ugly design with a $100 higher price tag but a flawless seamless integration, I would gladly pay. I dont want to have to think when I come home, I want to flop on the couch and just watch tv. Bottom line I wanted to love the Studio, but in the end with all its perks comes unnecessary issues that I dont really need.I DONT recommend it as a Fire TV Cube theater system set up.I DO recommend it as a standalone bluetooth speaker.","Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2020",AG26GMN44OCT7YYAZGHOUDU5IORA,True,23,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R12A3EFAZAF4E2,B07G9Y3ZMC,1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous for disabled or elderly,inger lise,1,"Update 3/30/24. I'm disabled and use a wheelchair. This AI Alexa thing has started doing its own routines and hunches and is now turning off my wheelchair charger at night when it's supposed to be charging-because it hears me go to sleep. It also turns lights off at night that I need left on so I can find my wheelchair. It also decides to turn on every light in the house, whether I want them on or not just because I did once. I thought I had the Alexa hunch issue fixed by deleting all routines and schedules in the app regarding everything! However that isn't a solution either because it turned off the plug for my wheelchair charger again again last night for the fourth time! I woke to a dead wheelchair again this morning! Had to spend the day in bed letting it charge. It's plug had been turned off again during the night! For the app it does this as ""hunches"" and evidently there doesn't seem any way to turn the ""hunches"" off! Additionally, this afternoon I discovered the Studio Sub was offline because it's plug had been turned off too by Amazon Alexa without my permission! It also turns light bulbs off at night when I need them left on so I can see to find my wheelchair! So I called Amazon tech support just now to get help. He wasn't much more helpful than Alexa herself. He suggested I remove the routines from Alexa app. When I told him I'd done had I had already done that days ago but it only helped for a bit,, He had no solutions- no answers beyond apologizing. He did ask though if I was using Apple? So maybe this thing is not Android friendly in spite of them saying it is?My advice is do not get anything relying on Alexa, if you are handicapped or elderly- it extremely dangerous! Amazon AI is not smart enough for disabled or elderly people yet. Alexa also has major issues hearing elderly people who have dentures, or any sort of an accent or speech impediment or stutteringAmazon should buy this stuff back-way too primitive and dangerous.+++ February 2024 update!I've had this speaker for about a month. Also have it's sub. At this moment I'm sitting here spending Friday night typing instead of watching my movie, because the Studio as usualjust disconnected the speakers from the TV with a half hour yet to go on a movie! No sound at all and I can't get it reconnected! The fire stick remote won't work and Alexa Studio just keeps saying something to the effect of ""it's having issues and can't think""..... So I decided to take a break, calm down, and write this review update! Sadly this happens on a daily basis- the connectivity issue with this thing is real, frequent and terrible! The TV, Studio Speaker and Sub are all within 10 feet of our router! No reason for all the issues! When it's good it sounds amazing- but unfortunately having it cut out in the middle of the movie is nothing but frustration. The Studio also has trouble understanding things. It has trouble understanding the simplest of commands and stops movies or YouTube shows, for no reason, or starts talking about topics or showing topics on YouTube that I didn't even ask for- eavesdrops a lot. If I actually need anything Alexa related I usually go back to the bedroom and ask the Echo Dot instead!I had Amazon tech support contact me because of my one star original review and unhappiness with this. They were able to resolve the buzzing issue the speakers had. Turns out moving them further away from our older metal filled TV helps. So they're now 5 ft away from the TV and in the middle of the room and the buzzing issue is resolved.However they're in the middle of the room..... I find the connectivity issue appalling in view of the fact that everything else made nowadays comes Plug and Play!Because of this ongoing issue that Amazon seems to not be able to resolve, I still do not recommend this Studio speaker at all!Original review -This has been a problem since setup- it's definitely not Plug and Play. You would think that something from the same company would hook up easily together, but sluggish updates and incompatible connectivity issues made it take an entire weekend to set up. And if you move it? You have to start all over again. This speaker is buzzy already and I've only had it a few weeks. Have to keep it at low volume which defeats the whole purpose of having it.Additionally it's about half as smart as the Dot I have in the bedroom. 'Studio"" doesn't listen or understand me most of the time. For example, I asked it to play Teskey Brothers. And it starts talking about super bowl instead! And it stops the music on the rare occasions it does play what I want- so it can play commercials for things that it wants to sell from Amazon!I so regret that the return window has passed.Save your money for something else. This thing's 10% enjoyment and 90% aggravation.Not even your worst enemy deserves the frustration this thing spews.","Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2024",AHKQ2TFRETJ6EWN2JZOPVKOULRIA,True,16,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R1K291J1WHOFUX,B07G9Y3ZMC,4.0 out of 5 stars Good sound quality. A small learning curve. Updated review.,Jeb,4,"The media could not be loaded. I'm an audiophile (I love good sound), and this sounds good enough for my kitchen. It gets loud enough for me, but I wouldn't count on it for blasting some ""Snoop Doggy Dog"" at a party (that's an old person joke). I had some trouble learning the command to get it to play music or podcasts when coupled with my other Echo Dot in the living room. It's very specific... ""Alexa play the song Eat It by the band Weird Al on Spotify on the Everywhere group."" It's a mouthful. With little information online I was very frustrated in figuring that out at first, and I had to resort to the Alexa app that you download on your phone for setup to sort-of get the answer. There is a chat bot there which is helpful. Otherwise, not so straight forward, so I'm providing it (the group command) here for anyone else with the same problem. But now that it's working I'm happier with this product. My mother wouldn't be able to set it up alone. You do have to raise your voice over the music to turn it down with a verbal command. One thing I don't like is that when you ask it to play a podcast Alexa reads not only the podcast title of the show she is about to play, but also the description of the show that is usually listed below the title. It can be quite a lengthy description, so she may go on for some time before getting to the play button. Also, unless you pay for Prime Music Unlimited membership some musical functions are limited. Like a few times it wouldn't let me skip forward. That's very frustrating when The Eagles come on. Alexa will prompt you to buy the Unlimited feature with a full pitch that takes a good 20 seconds to ge through before the pesky Eagles resume. Eventually I learned how to shut off this ad, but then I got it again today when I asked it to play Led Zeppelin. Not sure why. Eventually I hope to figure out how to shut off all ads. I also thought this device would speak Chinese, a language I am learning, but strangely it is not included in the list of 20 or so available tongues. Which is a little strange to me since Mandarin is the second most spoken language in the world. Apparently there is a language learning app you can set up, but I haven't figured that out yet. If I do I will update this review. Beyond those issues I'm very happy with this product. If Amazon were to make a home stereo system that was wireless for your entire house, they'd do well.","Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2024",AEY2A4YXRDQK3Z7ZPE56TFSUPSCQ,True,19,Color: GlacierConfiguration: Device only

R2531VWH8P4N66,B07G9Y3ZMC,"2.0 out of 5 stars Mediocre sound, awful implementation.",cowboy,2,"If they made it easier to connect too it would be great. Im considering sending mine back to get a sonos, only because our fire tv wont connect to it, and its such a hassle using a firetv stick on a fire tv just to get audio. If they would push the home theater option to all fire tv's and sticks and what not, it would be an ok setup. But your regular tv wont connect to it, your fire tv wont connect to it. its a real expensive speaker to add to the living room, when its so hard to integrate with the tv.Yes i could buy a echo link. That would solve my problem. But that brings cost of the single speaker audio setup to over $350 after tax and all. You really need two studios and a link for any kind of decent theater audio. That brings total cost too $583 in washington. Tooo much for what it is.You can hear all of the audio coming from the single point of the echo. No technical foolery they are using changes that. Its sound coming from a single point. So get two they say. The echo balls are not a great option because of lack of living room theater mounting options not to mention an audio quality mismatch with the studio. And another studio is darned expensive to fix what they sell as a one speaker theater setup. A sound bar is soooooo much better. Im going to go back to my old boston sound bar in the mean time. Sounds so much better. And i get no single point of sound problem with it.9/3/23 Update: The connection issues have not improved for me yet. Now when i talk to them, at least twice a day, they tell me that cant help me with that because they have dropped internet connection. its not my network. i have no issues with any other devices on my wifi. I believe that the theater wifi connection and the connection to my router is too much for the studios to handle. Probably its a software issue there.However!:I somehow missed that it has an optical input. I have hooked them up via a fiber cable to the tv and now, every single issue ive had with connection to just the tv is solved. Now the only glaring problems is if i want to use more than one device and the constant disconnecting from wifi. I have not been able to get the Theater setup to accept that optical input. If they would allow a theater group to be set up sans TV, and then allow the audio for the group to come from a single optical input on one of the devices, it would be a much more simple and foolproof way to get the audio into the theater system. Connection issues would become far less of a problem. There may be an almost insignificant audio timing issue with that sort of setup, but thats a tiny issue thats not difficult to fix.Anyhow if your looking for a great sound and dont mind the optical cable hooking to the back of your tv, everything including xboxs, playstations, and streaming devices like rokus will send their audio through hdmi to your tv and out via optical to your speaker.My one last thought on the optical cable to solve problems. If you split your optical cable into two, and use two studios like i am on either side of the tv it sounds pretty great, though its not even stereo. The one thing that would make it better is if in the alexa app i could select which channel i wanted to play on each echo unit. The optical is delivering atmos, because im using passthrough on my tv. Each of the Studios could, in their onboard software, selectively play a single channel from that 8.1 channel optical signal. But the whole reason this Studio/Theater software is taking so long to fix glaring issues is because of the cuts in personnel in the alexa/echo branches of amazon. So my hope is very small.9/19/23 update.Im now just pissed i spent the money on them. Ive had them to long for return. They just dont work. The optical connectio has two huge issues. The DAC or something freezes and you get no audio. Have to power cycle the device to get audio back. Which is a real pain since you cant reset it through the app. The ither issue is that there is some insane crackle that goes on with audio being to loud. At those volume its fine if your connected via bluetooth.The atmos is pure fiction with this thing. Songs i know real well are completely missing frequencies and there isnt an eq accessible in the app for the speaker. It needs so much improvement it hurts. Worth maybe $70, only because they can get pretty loud. Complete ripoff otherwise. Trash is what they are as far as i can tell.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2023",AH7ADKRRAGBGOUXFNT53DO2J7ASQ,True,13,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

I remember hearing about the Amazon hardware group suffering cuts last year, so when I saw this thing hasn't been axed yet, I wanted to offer my support since I have loved it for 4 years now.I'm not an audiophile, but I care more about sound quality than your average person. Also, I'm not one of those people that has the luxury of buying 10 different products and comparing them, so my assessment is somewhat limited in that regard. But all that really matters, I think, is that this thing blew me away day one, and it's going strong 4 years later.We have it in our main living room/kitchen/dinette which has 10 foot ceilings and is an open concept with total footprint of about 30'x20' and this thing does a very solid job of filling the room. Of course, bigger, dedicated speakers would sound better, but then you have to screw around with an AV receiver, multiple pieces, running wires (or at least power for each speaker), and trying to make it all look good. This thing looks sleek at one end of the 20'x30' room, has a single necessary cord (power), and provides impressive sound given the tight package everything is crammed in.I understand there are other speakers out there that would sound just as good, if not better (Bose, Sonos, etc.), but I want to emphasize that this is phenomenal for the $200 price point.","Reviewed in the United States April 13, 2024",AH3UO6QEBOMYDI2F446AHSTK425Q,True,7,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

I've got it cranked and it doesn't balance with the mid and highs. Only reason I upgraded was to get a fuller and richer sound. The spatial processing makes the sound worse...at least in the room I have it in. Small room...15' x 15'.*After submitting my review an Amazon Outreach Representative called me to see if they could help and troubleshoot the problem. Basically a reset and maybe move to a different location. So I did and I have to admit, not a whole lot of difference. I did move the speaker closer to where I sit so yes, sound is definitely better but that's just because it's closer. All that being said...I do appreciate that they reached out so they get a star for that. I might still do a full-on factory reset and see what happens...","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AF36GKJIKBEWIBEJGSR7VDRIITEQ,True,1,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R3E072JTKXRRNV,B07G9Y3ZMC,"3.0 out of 5 stars Misleading description, sound quality just decent. Atmos does not work on PC.",D,3,"UPDATE #1: I found out how to control the sound settings. I just decided to try saying, ""Alexa, decrease bass"" and it flashed and while I could not tell for sure, I tried another command, ""Alexa, decrease bass to minimum"" then afterwards I said ""Alexa, increase bass to max"" and there was a significant difference. Alexa confirmed my settings were applied when I tried to increase bass after being already maxed out and Alexa responded by saying, ""Bass is already set to max."" This also works with Treble. Hope this helps some of you out.Dolby atmos does not work on PC and it sounds like a mid to low end stereo over bluetooth. This was confirmed through the Dolby Access app for the PC. I hope to find out that I am wrong about this. I did read that I can supposedly get up to 5.1 surround but it requires another adapter that I just placed an order for and will update to see if it actually works. Aux cable does not register to my PC or smartphone at all and customer service technician could not figure out how to get it to work and stated they will send me an email with instructions within 30 minutes. It has been several hours as of this review with no updates.I always find that most people who say the sound quality of a certain speaker is excellent/audiophile quality usually have no idea what they're talking about. I would bet most are running this over bluetooth and not realizing it does not allow the full features of what this speaker supposedly can put out. It has a punchy bass and that causes the illusion that the speakers sound better. As far as I know, this product requires a cable to utilize its dolby atmos, and the Amazon service tech could not confirm or deny this. However, read the description that says it works with the latest Firesticks and other devices but not with older gen. Perhaps this means for TVs, you can still wireless connect over bluetooth and utilize dolby atmos.I have not tried it on a TV for dolby atmos but as stated above, the description implies you may need to get an optical cable to connect with your TV for the dolby atmos. However, one of my biggest problems with this is that you cannot adjust sound settings. I don't want the bass on at night because I don't want to disrupt my neighbors, and there is literally no way to adjust that or any other highs/mid/lows. I'm hoping the optical cable will allow me to adjust settings with the sound card driver on my PC.On a similar note, it is worth mentioning that not being able to adjust the bass affects the sound quality of movies, as it often adds too much bass to the voices of the actors and sounds odd. Additionally, it adds almost a reverb to the voice, which I tried adjusting through windows sound settings by turning off spatial sound and digital surround. Nothing seems to fix the issue. I have loudness equalization turned on and while it helps movies and music, the Alexa notifications come out at a significantly louder volume to the point where I have to turn it down only to have to turn the volume back up when I resume a movie or playlist.This device doesn't allow you to use the built in mic for the majority of apps outside of Amazon but it will set the default mic on your PC to the Echo Studio. This is annoying because you will have to manually go into every single app that the Echo mic does not work and change it back to your original mic.In any case, until I can hear how it sounds with dolby atmos or even 5.1 surround, I would say do not believe the hype that these are audiophile quality as they sound worse than my $70 bluetooth speakers. These don't sound bad, just don't expect to be blown away over bluetooth.","Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2022",AGHUFB6Z5JSXM2F7WAXFA4S64LDQ,True,4,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R3JKSRM2TPQNT1,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Family approves!,Jason,5,"My reviews are long to provide my reason for purchase, how I like it, etc...if you don't care for all that...here's the short version: Sound is amazing coming from a 3rd Gen dot, not quite the highs or lows a proper speaker setup provides, but it's space saving compared to that and produces very balanced room filling sound.Full Review:I purchased this as an early family present to replace a Gen 3 dot and Gen 1 dot, the sound blows of those away. Even at first plugin, it started up with a tone that more or less spanned the range of what the Studio can handle...everyone's head turned at me in awe, including myself. My family loves music..lots of music...from K-Pop to Metal, and everything in between. The size of the Studio is definitely larger than the dots, comparable to a medium sized pot. While the sound quality is better bthan the Gen 3 dot in both fidelity and clarity, it is still behind proper 2 or 2.1ch+ speaker setups, in case there are some hoping to replace that (again we love music and enjoy it as close to how t was intended). That said, if it'san upgrade to one of the smaller Echo models and/or tired of connecting to a larger speaker system (this is my case) for sound, the Studio is the way to go. The sound the Studio puts out is well balanced: highs, mids and lows are not muddied together nor tinny. The fidelity and clarity is wonderful coming from a single small device and with the multiple speakers built in, the Studio fills a room with sound with ease; whether it be for background music or for listening to the latest album. I still prefer the sound that my tower speakers and sub produces...but it satisfies my families ears without the need to tell Alexa to first connect to speaker...really it's so good that I'm looking into getting a second to further enhance the Soundstage, better separation of left and right, of an already phenomenal Echo speaker.","Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2023",AH5HEZ2BNEI4XPEAR5AHVRVEZK4A,True,1,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
RLM0TLECS5LEH,B07G9Y3ZMC,"4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Dolby Atmos sound, BUT...",Amanda Benson,4,"Pros:If you are using Amazon Music Unlimited and have a large library of Dolby Atmos songs, you will love the depth of sound from the Echo Studio.ConsNon Atmos/360 songs sound like a cheap AM radio. Mono/Echo sounding. You can disable the ""Spacial Enhancement"" option in the Alexa app which helps a little, but the speaker should be smart enough to play lower quality formats.I'm including comments on the Amazon Music app here because the speaker can't be used without ""some"" app, and the Amazon App is what I use.So many things wrong with the app.View library by Album and it sorts by recent activity instead of Album name. Same if you view by artist.If you don't have Music unlimited your playlists are useless. Amazon ""says"" users asked for access to a bigger song library so their solution is to mix random songs into your playlist. BS.They changed the definition of library. My library used to contain songs I purchased and playlists. Now it contains everything.Can't see the quality of the song you are playing. Plenty of room to show it on the now playing screen but they don't. Why? They don't want you to see how many songs are not high quality I guess. Maybe they just have bad designers, developers.No volume control in the app. They have one in the Alexa app. So you have keep both apps running, which you really need to anyway to enable/disable the spacial enhancement option.Optical line-in port is almost useless. Go read the forums. Too much to include here.Seems like every ""enhancement"" they've made to the app lately is a step backwards.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023",AGOXK4UJTB7ZXJUMJXMIA5NSR7AA,True,4,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R1S8CNPBPFMH6J,B07G9Y3ZMC,4.0 out of 5 stars Disappointed if you want to use as a Fire TV speaker .... maybe not so much,Judith F Wagner,4,"I own numerous echo devices, from the Shows to the Dots and Towers and Fire tablets, so I'm all in the Amazon ecosystem. I bought a Fire TV and then this Studio to use as a speaker last year. I have not gotten the Studio to work well with the TV yet. First, I tried Bluetooth, but the sound and lips would not sync, no matter how much I played with it. Then I tried Amazon Home Theater. This eliminated the sync issues, but the TV and the Studio would unpair every couple of DAYS. I did a factory reset on the Studio and then had trouble connecting it to a strong internet signal, so I set it next to the router to connect to the internet. I also tried using an optical cable to hard-wire the two but all I got were crackling noises. So I went back to Amazon Home Theater -- and I always have to reconnect the Studio and TV, after unplugging them both -- a real pain. I was going to get a second Studio and the Echo subwoofer, but not now because of my experience with this Studio and Fire TV (both Amazon products); just not staying connected. If anyone knows how to fix it, please post. ThanksAug 22, 2023. I'm updating my review as Amazon Home Theater seems much more stable, so I'm increasing the stars on the Studio to 4. My main problem was never the sound, but the connection between the studio and my Fire TV. I am only losing the connection between the Fire TV with the Studio maybe once every two weeks now vs. once every two days. I'm pretty sure it's on the Studio side as when I go to reconnect, the Fire TV doesn't recognize the Studio that is sitting next to it. I try the next day and it works. So I'm going to be brave and get the second Studio and see if I can really get a home theatre system going. The home theater still baffles me as I have FIOS's top internet package so it should support everything. To give Amazon kudos, someone called me on this, but I couldn't recreate the problem with regularity, so it was impossible to work with them.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2023",AE4J5S7XQP6KXPRLJNHX6RA3CCWA,True,0,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R22JR4K6G132W6,B07G9Y3ZMC,"3.0 out of 5 stars Hard to review; moments of greatness, let down by buggy music software and variable sound quality",Townie,3,"First unit arrived used and damaged, so Amazon sent me a second that was brand new. We are using both for music (mostly). I use Amazon Prime Music HD and my wife uses Spotify. Spotify works very well and seems to be stable. Amazon Prime Music is very buggy. Firstly, if it continues playing similar music, it always replays the last song already played first. Secondly, it cannot distinguish between different artists with the same name and so you get some random musical styles. Thirdly, the Amazon Music phone app and the device lose sync regularly. The Alexa phone app and the device also lose sync regularly, so there is no way to reliably see what is currently playing. Sometimes fast forwarding a song will cause the message ""an error has occurred"" and sometimes a song will not play even though it is available and has played previously. Sometimes songs that are unavailable will play, which is a bonus...Sound quality wise I find the unit sometimes sounds excellent and balanced and sometimes sounds trebly and sibilant, there is no rhyme or reason to how it will sound. Sometimes the bass speaker will stop working and you have to reboot the unit (I had to reset it and re-set it up from scratch).The front firing tweeter does not produce any sound with spatial audio disabled (and hardly produces any sound with spatial audio turned on). So most of what you hear is the two side firing speakers and the bass speaker (when it chooses to work). The upward firing speaker seems to also only work with spatial audio enabled. This is an issue because spatial audio does not sound good on all material. Material specifically developed with it in mind sounds great, but everything else sounds echo-ey.Note also that there is no volume leveling feature for any of the music services, so you will play one song and then the next will be 5 times louder, so you are constantly asking Alexa to change volume. This is, of course, unless you use it with Bluetooth, but the sound quality won't be as good.As a smart speaker, when the unit works properly it sounds really good - in fact it almost seems to break the laws of physics, it sounds so large. Hopefully there will be a fix for the non-spatial material (getting all the speakers to actually work) and the instability.As for the smart part, it is useful for news and weather, but trying to get suggestions on where to buy something for example comes up with completely inappropriate results. For example, asking where you can buy ""home décor items"" will get suggestions for coffee shops or bakeries mixed in with chain stores. Also, be careful if you banter with the unit because there is a chance you could accidently subscribe to an entertainment subscription service.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2024",AGOW7SHC7JPSTG7R2ITQIPWPRY4A,True,2,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R2PJ2PKBWW4L71,B07G9Y3ZMC,4.0 out of 5 stars Definite audio improvement compared to other echos,Dopest Nerd on the Block,4,"Received the echo studio yesterday, I've only got about an hour of listening in. Wrote the following while listening and setting it up.1. Could not get studio connected to my 5g network, only 2.4g. I haven't looked into it yet.2. Setup and integration into my existing Alexa set-up was easy.3. Looks great4. It's no audiophile speaker but definite improvement over the echo and echo plus.5. Immediately the vocals are center stage. The three 2"" mid driver's project the sound around the room while not letting the vocals get lost.6. The 1""tweeter delivers bright crisp highs7. And having a 5¼"" speaker to handle the lower frequencies in the music really makes this speaker sound and feel like a bookshelf style speaker. I may just have to purchase another for pairing into a stereo set.I'm going to pair the studio with my echo sub just to hear. I've been playing the echo studio for a bit now. Playing songs from different genres, 80's, 90's, 2K, Amazon music 3D, HD, and ultra HD.First impression... Compared to echo and echo plus. Eq flat and spatial enhancement on.1. Noticably louder2. Highs more present and crisper3. Vocals not as muffledI temporarly have the echo studio in a bedroom I converted to a small home theater. Room is 12ftx12ft with 10ft ceiling. Speaker was placed in center of room on foot rest/table. (Amazon suggest having it 6"" from a wall. I'll play with that later when I figure out where it works best in it's possible final destination, the family room.) The echo studio filled the room. I was sitting on the couch in front of the echo studio. With my eyes closed I could follow the sound around the room like a globe. When I would turn off the spatial enhancement you could hear and feel the ""sound globe"" get smaller and closer to the speaker.The first 3d song on the playlist Alexa tells you to ask to play was a bad example. ""The steps"" by Haim. There are weird distortions in the music. I thought too myself (what a wonderful world. You know that's where your brain wanted to go) this is horrible sounding. Turned off the spatial enhancement (SE) and still not good. Went to the next song and was relieved that it was the song and not the speaker.As I said earlier I played a handful of songs from Amazon music. Turning on/off the SE, adjusted the EQ a little. It's tough with Amazon music, the sound quality from song to song (unless they're all on one album) is super inconsistent. You don't notice this on the dot and if your listening you can almost kind of hear it on the echo and echo plus. But it's pretty tough to hear unless you know what to listen for. As the quality of your speaker or system gets better, the distortion, compression become more noticeable. Before subscribing to the HD music I couldn't even listen to Amazon music in my car without cringing from the distortion, inconsistent compression, and/or hollow sounding songs (Lincoln Parks ""hybrid theory"" is a good example of distorted highs. And it sounds like it was recorded in a tin can) HD subscription helps the sound quality a lot but doesn't eliminate the issues.Overall I like what I heard. Definitely need to play with it some more. Let the speakers get broke in. After about 30-50 hours overall sound should warm up and be a bit smoother.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2020",AFCT25XNPMGHORXQWFFD35OH5UIQ,True,2,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R1DBYAELBM6GPR,B07G9Y3ZMC,3.0 out of 5 stars Echo Studio Review and Sonos Speakers,Tall woman,3,"Once I start this review I would like to mention that I did a lot of research before I purchased the Echo Studio product. My 7 year old Sony sound bar for my TV suddenly died and was not fixable or in order to fix it was too pricey. Let me first say this product is for a second home and the room functions as a bedroom and entertainment room. This room is not a home theater so what I am trying to describe is I didn’t need a robust sound system based on the room size and function. Also, I did want a system (speaker) where I could listen to music and have good sound from the TV. Finally, I should mention I have Play1 Sonos speakers (1st Generation so no smart functions) at my primary home. Okay, understanding all those areas let me provide my review…I have had the Echo Studio for about 2 ½ months and the sound is very good with the music and playing through the TV in the size of the room as I described above. The smart functions are nice to have but I will be honest I don’t really need to have them. Based on the research I did and reviews on Amazon and outside of Amazon said the sound from speaker was almost as good as the Sonos play1 speakers and I have to disagree. My personal opinion is the sound from Sonos is much better and the functions with Sonos app are 95% better for music lovers. What do I mean by that statement is I feel there are limits with the Echo Studio based on functions and performance for music lovers or as a primary speaker for music and tv in a smaller size room. The following list below includes the limitation of the echo studio.• Always defaults to Amazon Music ( I recently changed the function within the app to my favorite music platform but Alexa still goes to Amazon music but not as much). If I want it to go to a favorite station of mine I need to be specific in my statement by naming the station exactly. And I am finding this very annoying b/c on my Sonos I have them saved and just go to the app and play them. So I have to look them up everytime if I want the echo studio to play them. This is a big fail for me.• Unable to save favorite stations• Doesn’t have the capability to store recent playlist or station. For example, if I like what Alexa did pick I say save that station and she communicates that function does not exist.• Also, I don’t find the Alex app helpful when it comes to the music element as the Sonos App is. Sonos app is seamless to me. Also, I love the Sonos app in terms of saving the history of what the user has listen to and I can store favorites.• The search function in the Sonos app is great because I can see all the options to play from all my linked music platforms. I want to communicate to those individuals who are music lovers and are using many online platforms for their music. And understanding the difference between the two products. If you are reading this review and your in the market in purchasing a speaker for music and to play through the TV. I would highly recommend Sonos speaker b/c it is seamless more flexibility and more functions within the Sonos app that is not offered through the Alex app. This is why I am doing this review b/c that was not mention in my research and if I had known I would have spent more money for those functions and flexibility. I realized that I did get a better price but for me at what cost. I will say I am good with my echo studio and it does sound good. But if I had known what I know now, I would have gone with a Sonos speaker.

RJHIL4FZZLP6R,B07G9Y3ZMC,"5.0 out of 5 stars If you are a Koolaid drinking Prime movie and music subscriber, you need this...",GreatNorth,5,"To start with: the Amazon Music App and Alexa app don't play nice together, but its getting better; Alexa app likes priority power! Also flipping from app to Fire 4K Max has interface issues. It's getting old unpairing speakers and clearing caches... When music or movies stop for 10 minutes, it should default to next command pinging it and not mate for life!!....The software issues aired... I bought two of these with the sub to justify my monthly unlimited music fee along with the Prime membership; both of which keep going north.... I am old enough to remember when the Dire Straights Brothers in Arms CD DDD cost $26 bucks, but if you had a CD player, this was a life changing listening experience! So I'm conditioned within reason, but am a frugal value buyer.I am a self proclaimed audiophile, but that is arbitrary based on your music, room, ears and budget, but I have always paid up for ""Hearing"" sound value. A $10k amp/pre sounds only as good as your speakers. No the Studios aren't that, but for a smart Alexa speaker you can't engineer or make a speaker set for your $200 investment. Amazon is even or losing on selling these to get you enrolled in the unlimited music; HD, ultra HD, Atomos, 3D etc... and it works. Very smart.Will they make a TV sound experience better, obviously, compared to factory tv pairings. Will they play your music subscriptions epic on your go to listening personal high end system, blow your hair back, chair? That is your call. Prime: return if not. My easy answer is that Amazon doesn't currently make a better speaker with the versatility the studio has, and I own everything they sell related to sound... truly.Amazon isn't intentionally trying to price themselves out of the music streaming services and the value here is that they are committed to getting it right. Many of the settings adjustments have been firmware updated to work as it should of been from origin, but tip of the hat for addressing weaknesses. Most high end audiophile speaker companies aren't going to swap out the cross-overs or update the digital footprint because you spent $35k on a set of speakers you think should clear the air better. Get a calculator out. $200x amazon customers, x customers who subscribe to music and movies..... it's millions$$$! Amazon will stay proactive and reactive when necessary to keep us happy! Buy the speaker/s, it's a brilliant 150-200 dollar investment considering a tank of gas is $100. Money well spent, stress well relieved and a chance to re-listen to music, that doesn't sound the same as it did over the years. It's incredible what smaller size chambers/arrangements deliver these days, it's a new digital ballgame; Get in it!","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2022",AFQHYJRRFLPGLCLZ6L5J6K7WJTRQ,True,17,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R2D8D7TKTGVPE7,B07G9Y3ZMC,"4.0 out of 5 stars Echo Alexa Clarification on ""Spatial Audio"" and MORE...",Rob in Boston,4,"""Spatial Audio"" is NOT A SETTING on Echo or Alexa. It's a playlist that you must request verbally while operating Alexa once you have Amazon Music Unlimited (which you must purchase additionally as with other music platforms.) If you are already an Amazon Prime member, the added five bucks is worth it. With Amazon Music Unlimited, Alexa becomes your slave). Understand, with basic Amazon Music, the sound is suppressed (It sucks.) It's better to fork out a few more bucks for the Unlimited (and you're the boss). 2) Once you pay for Amazon Music Unlimited, the sound improves significantly. 3) ""Spatial Sound"" IS NOT A SETTING for your device. It's merely a marketing ploy. It's simply a playlist that only works if you subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited. THERE IS NO SETTING ON ALEXA FOR ""SPATIAL SOUND."" Once you have Amazon Music Unlimited, you say to Alexa (on your Echo device), ""Alexa, play the best of spatial audio playlist."" What you get is random pop music, most of which is redundant and not rewarding. Keep your settings basic. Do get Amazon Unlimited because you are in command. You can skip without suppression at any time. If you ask Alexa a general question, it's usually okay, but sometimes it's ridiculous how badly a question can be misinterpreted. I like my Echo Studio. It doesn't allow much finessing of the volume. I'm searching for a compatible 16 band equalizer (which probably doesn't exist) but it tells you I'm encouraged by the sound of this device. Don't be confused about ""Spatial Audio."" Also, keep the basic sound settings once you have the Echo Studio speaker. You can adjust simply by commanding: ""Alexa bass up,"" or ""Alexa, mid rage down,"" Or, ""Alexa Treble up 1,""etc. The same with volume. That's all I got. Don't want to overwhelm, but you need to know this stuff to get your money's worth.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2023",AFOXPE3SBO2H77JAPYDWAJHXMRTQ,True,6,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
RFQSXWQ0JW1MO,B07G9Y3ZMC,4.0 out of 5 stars Review of Echo Studio when paired with second Studio and the Echo Sub,Greg W.,4,"While it is true that, to date, the Echo Studio paired with another and the Echo Sub is one of the best ways to listen to Amazon Music Unlimited, there are some drawbacks.The first is probably the price. You really don't need to pair two together if you can't afford it and the Echo Sub does not automatically add as much bass by default as you would like.I don't want to split hairs, but the Echo Remote works with the Echo Studio much better in one-speaker format.In paired mode, you can sync the remote, you can change the volume, and bypass the wake word with the press of a button, but you can't skip forward or go back with two of them working as a 2.1 system just with a press.I hope Amazon addresses this with a software update or that I am the only one for whom this happens. I sincerely doubt Amazon addresses this as they do not sell the remotes on their website anymore. It's a shame. I really prefer using the remotes.When you set these devices up on your smartphone or tablet, I learned the hard way that you need to re-enter your same address multiple times and label your rooms correctly for the sake of organization and using the drop-in feature.As for the sound quality of the streamed music, it's very good, but not excellent.It's very difficult for streamed music to sound great. I've listened to vinyl records and CD's and DVD Audio and music that was advertised as lossless, but streaming music for the time being is compressed by algorithms. Most people know that. And you know you're being robbed of sounds or data that make the file small enough to stream.If you are an audiophile, buying one of these Echo Studio devices was never on your to-do list.But the Echo Studio makes for a decent smart speaker. I like that I can control the thermostat and dim lights without spending much effort.I've owned previous generation Echo devices that had built-in thermometers. The Studio dropped that feature.I should tell you that I have also used Google Home and it seems to be more capable of answering my more complex questions.Yes, your smartphone is smarter. Your computer is obviously smarter.Basically, what I am saying is the Echo Studio is better than previous models from Amazon.I got what I paid for because I had realistic expectations. And it sounds very good on its own.I like that it adjusts to the acoustics of the room automatically when moved to new locations.To sum up: I like it. It has its limitations, but I like it.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2021",AGS5EEI55HXVRY7CXEEEHPB4OB2A,True,0,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R32FSCMBJUAVPY,B07G9Y3ZMC,"4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good speaker, bad exchange policy and service.",TheFirstMongoose,4,"Pretty good speaker. Bad exchange policy and customer service. I purchased two of these on Prime Day, since they were $50 off MSRP for a total of $100 savings. Tested both of them out and paired them together with the Echo Sub. Played music fine. Somewhat drowned out the bass from the subwoofer, but music was nice and clear. There really is no way to independently turn up the bass just on the Echo Sub since they are all connected now(two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub). Amazon needs to invest in these tweaks that would make a big difference.I discovered a day later that one of the Studios had a low static noise whenever I asked Alexa a question. It wasn’t on the other one/speaker. So I tried to troubleshoot and went through everything. Changing the WiFi band from 2.4 to 5.0 and back. Changing to different outlet. Unplugging for a few minutes. Nothing worked. Very noticeable if your within 3 feet and asking Alexa a question. When playing music however, the static seemed to disappear or so I thought. When the music is turned down, the static was still there. So I decided to call Amazon technical services. A tech/representative went through all the troubleshooting methods I had already tried and we determined that the speaker was faulty. I agreed to just have it replaced. When he was telling me on how to ship the faulty speaker back, he mentioned to not include any cords or pamphlets. That raised a red flag and I asked if I was receiving a new or refurbished unit for a replacement. He said he doesn’t know or would not know until it ships. So I end the call with him and go to my Amazon account to look at the replacement being shipped. It’s a REFURBISHED! Nothing wrong with refurbished, but I bought new not refurbished. So Amazon should be replacing with a new one. Right out of the box there was a static. It’s not like I used it for a month. So I called back and tried to explain to a different representative. Come to find out, Amazon’s policy to correct such issues is either to refund your money or replace with new OR refurbished unit(their call), when it comes to Amazon devices. My argument is that this is a brand new device that was defective, sending a refurbished one should have NEVER been an option. What complicates thing now even more is that they are out of stock on new Studios. None expected in until a month and a half later. The second representative ended up canceling the refurbished replacement and said I can wait until they get new Studios in to do the exchange since she can’t even order a replacement due to the lack of stock. Either case, I’m not very happy on how this was all handled. Decent sounding speaker, but if you get a lemon, be prepared to get a refurbished one as an exchange. Or be vigilant like me and question it. I did notice other reviewers stating receiving replacements coming in generic boxes....those are refurbished. And there’s nothing wrong with refurbished if you originally bought refurbished or if you have owned that device for a number of days, weeks, months. That wasn’t my case. Brand new out of the box with a static noise and wasn’t offered a new replacement.","Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2020",AGHVYW7ZSEDM5NYEHVUUGLRSFCWA,True,13,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R1RN10WMSRQ3KP,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic sounding speaker that'll have me selling my Sonos & Apple Homepod.,Robert M.,5,"I'll get the conclusion out the way: The speaker sounds surprisingly greatFor context, I own 2 Sonos One speakers and an Apple Homepod. I've always been lukewarm on the Sonos as their sound, while fairly good, doesn't match their price in my opinion. The Homepod, too, has always felt overpriced if not a decent sounding speaker.When the Echo Studio was announced, I figured I'd give it a shot given I could always send it back with Amazon's excellent return policy if it didn't live up to snuff. $200 put it below the Homepod and right around the Sonos One pricepoint so my expectations were set around there.Setup was simple as the device came pre-linked with my Amazon account. It goes through an initial room test where it plays some tones to measure the size and placement within the room (something it does continually should you move it around anyway). After that, all that was left was to listen to some music.I started with some Sinatra to get a feel for the vocals, and was immediately impressed with the tone & clarity. You could easily pick up on the subtle percussion on the background and the band hits packed a punch when they came in behind him. Next I tried some classical to get a feel for the range and, again, came away impressed. You could feel the lows of the brass section just as well as the high strings. The material was all represented well.Ok, so how about something that thumps. I asked Alexa to play some Chemical Brothers and this is where I got really impressed. Too many speakers, in my opinion, emphasize the volume of bass over accuracy. You end up with a boomy sound that doesn't reflect the music properly. Not the Echo Studio. The bass was punchy, loud and accurate. I tried some Daft Punk and Deadmau5 and came away equally impressed with the tight bass and crisp highs.Next I tried some Metallica. I feel if there's a critique I'd have with the Echo Studio it'd be here. The mid guitars lack a little feel and all start to sound a bit muddied together. You get the bass, you get the highs, but the guitars lack a little range. This isn't at all uncommon on speakers like this (the Sonos are quite bad in this regard in my opinion), but it could definitely be better).I tried a handful of the 3D audio selections on Amazon Music. In short, you do get a wider soundstage which is interesting, but you lose something in the clarity of the music. It feels a little gimmicky maybe, but not necessarily in a bad way. Just an ""I don't know if this is actually an improvement or not"" kind of way.In short, I'm very, very impressed with the Echo Studio. It's priced right at $200, has tighter and more accurate bass than the Homepod and a much fuller range than the Sonos One. If you're looking for a good speaker for music (with the bonus of having Alexa built in), I can't recommend this one enough.I came in skeptical. I came away impressed.","Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2019",AGEO4KHJNLTE7T5EEH7TMYYB6PRQ,True,22,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

RMER9EFHP21YP,B07G9Y3ZMC,3.0 out of 5 stars Good as a single basic speaker but not for home theater,andrescolombia,3,"The Echo speaker I recently tried out is decent for basic functionalities but falls short in some key areas, particularly as a home theater option and its connectivity with Fire Stick. The speaker's limitations become evident when you push it beyond basic use. When attempting to use it as part of a home theater setup, the Echo speaker simply doesn't deliver the immersive audio experience needed. The sound lacks the depth and richness required for watching movies or playing high-definition content. It might be adequate for occasional TV shows or background music, but it cannot replace a dedicated home theater system.The connectivity with Fire Stick is another significant drawback. The pairing process is cumbersome and often unreliable. Even when connected, there is noticeable lag and occasional audio dropouts, which can be quite frustrating. This inconsistent performance severely undermines its utility as a companion to the Fire Stick, especially if you are looking to enjoy a seamless streaming experience.In summary, while the Echo speaker is a competent device for basic tasks and casual listening, it is not suitable as a home theater alternative. Additionally, its poor connectivity with the Fire Stick makes it a less-than-ideal choice for those looking to integrate it into their entertainment setup. If your needs are simple, this Echo speaker might suffice, but for more demanding audio and streaming applications, you might want to look elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2024",AFTJVJJXAQQQNXYG5XV2TM5GPUXA,True,1,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
R3SQY6FL92RWFI,B07G9Y3ZMC,"4.0 out of 5 stars Studio is a stretch, but certainly the best sounding Alexa device.",Jeff Helmes,4,"Alexa works flawlessly. Big plus since I bought it to replace a glitchy stereo pair of 3rd Gen Echoes in bedroom used for music & ocean wave sounds to help drift off to sleep. The stereo pairing suffered frustrating dropouts, with one or sometimes both speakers quitting in the middle of songs & very rarely played the ocean sounds through morning. But so far the Studio has worked perfectly.However, in spite of the Dolby Atmos credentials, the Studio doesn’t sound nearly as spacious as the paired Echoes (which I had in opposite corners of the room on the headboard wall, mounted about 5 feet high on candle sconces.) Paired also with an Echo Sub, this filled the room with sound rather nicely... well, whenever it all worked simultaneously. But the glitches simply became untenable, so I grabbed a Studio during Prime Day...At first I put the Studio near a corner of the room on a dresser, pointing the front toward the bed. Sounded tinny. Made sure I had upgraded to Amazon HD & played Best of 3D... Still barely any immersion of sound whatsoever. Very disappointing. Moved speaker to center of wall, still on dresser... Better but still not very impressive. (And yes I did keep the Echo Sub, now paired to the Studio.) I let it play all day while at work to break in the speaker & allow the room tuning to recalibrate... No avail.Finally I moved the Studio to a speaker stand, centered on the far wall facing the bed. The sound was significantly improved. Still not what I’d expect from a product claiming Dolby Atmos, but certainly better sound immersion. I think the side-firing speakers work far better in space, rather than bouncing sound off a near surface. Clearly the Studio is intended to point at the listener’s face & it must to achieve any reasonable degree of sound immersion. Regardless I did prefer the sound of paired Echoes with Sub over the Studio + Sub... but not enough to go back to all the frustrating glitches.No doubt paired Studios would sound better than the paired Echos, but I don’t want to return to the annoying dropouts. Besides for $300-400, a stereo pair of Sonos Ones would be better sounding with rock solid reliability.Bottom line is I will stick with the Studio because it has been so reliable & good enough sounding for a bedroom. The Echo pair absolutely demanded a Sub for quality music. However the Studio doesn’t depend on it since it has a woofer, unlike all other Echoes. So at $150 (on sale) I would recommend a Studio for a bedroom or kitchen where music will be played, but stereophile audio quality isn’t required. But for a living room or den where you may prefer excellent sound quality, I would highly recommend a Dot & a stereo pair of Sonos One SLs, or better yet the Sonos Five.","Reviewed in the United States October 27, 2020",AFE34T7J4PA4UBVAWCSE3BY7MHIA,True,1,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

I bought two of them and have them paired up. So far it has been amazing. Here's what I love about them:- In paired mode, the speakers sound incredible. I have tried both ""spatial"" and ""non-spatial"" settings and both sound pretty good.- I recently upgraded my fire TV to a fire stick 4K and the dolby sound that comes when watching a movie/show is outstanding- Speaker is so good that I sold off my regular speakers which were really nice, but I truly don't need them anymore- microphone pickup is outstanding. even if music is playing I can say Alexa and usually it hears me- When compared to the google mini I had, I notice that the home automation stuff I have is faster. Like ""Alexa turn on kitchen light"" it responds instantlyCons:- I have spotify and frankly spotify integration sort of sucks. I can't say ""shuffle music"", i doesn't work. if i say ""play more songs like this"" it doesn't work. playing of music will just stop mid-stride for no reason. even ""play that song that goes shake it like a polaroid picture"" doesn't work. i'm really disappointed with spotify on echo studios. so i tried out amazon music with a free offer, and guess what? of course everything works perfectly. i'm a little bit bothered that i may have to migrate from spotify or change to a different type of speaker. with my google mini, spotify worked perfectly.- i have my speakers paired, and because of this, using the communication feature of the echo studio when paired doesn't work. i found out it will only work if i unpair the speakers. i submitted a bug but there's been no fix for weeks. irritating!- the speakers can be buggy. sometimes the speakers will unpair for no reason. i had initially setup my speakers on a different wi-fi network name. so i changed it to the one I want. i went to amazon and told it to not remember any old wi-fi names. but for some reason, they would randomly re-connect to the old connection. I finally did a factory reset and did it all again and now it seems to work without switching back.Pretty much what I have come to believe/realize is that these speakers are all about the amazon echo-system. I don't see a priority for it to work with spotify because they want you to switch to amazon music. The hardware itself is great, so I may actually follow what they planned and switch to amazon music. But I'm irritated about it. The alexa app is okay, but kind of buggy.So I would've given it 5 stars, but give it 4. I'm still extremely happy because I love the sound from teh paired speakers. and watching movies with atmos is amazing, like for the first time i feel like you can hear sounds coming from the side or further away or atmospheric sounds. my old home theater system never sounded this good.If you're a huge spotify user, I'd stay away and maybe go for the Sonos. But if you're ambivalent about your music service, this works perfect with amazon music. And so far with my fire stick 4k the sound with the paired speakers is amazing.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2020",AF6VS6H6CI4SH6K3VNI4WTDDURRA,True,3,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R2CBUR91SFMZ2N,B07G9Y3ZMC,5.0 out of 5 stars Immersive Sound Experience with the Echo Studio,Morgan,5,"Pros:1. **Exceptional Audio Quality:** The Echo Studio lives up to its claim as Amazon's best-sounding smart speaker, delivering an impressive audio experience with clear highs, rich mids, and deep bass, providing a well-rounded sound profile.2. **Dolby Atmos Support:** The inclusion of Dolby Atmos enhances the audio immersion, creating a three-dimensional sound experience that adds depth and realism to music, movies, and other audio content.3. **Spatial Audio Processing:** The spatial audio processing technology contributes to a sense of surround sound, making the listening experience more immersive and engaging, especially for those who appreciate a high-quality audio setup.Cons:1. **Large Size:** The Echo Studio's substantial size may be a drawback for users with limited space, as it requires a significant footprint. Consideration of available space is essential before incorporating it into your home.2. **Higher Price Point:** While the audio quality justifies the cost, the Echo Studio's higher price may be a limiting factor for budget-conscious consumers seeking a more affordable smart speaker option.3. **Alexa Integration Learning Curve:** For users new to smart speakers or voice-activated assistants, the integration with Alexa may take some time to master. Learning the various voice commands and features could be challenging for beginners.4. **Limited Color Options:** The availability of the Echo Studio in only a charcoal color may be a limitation for those who prefer more diverse options to match their home decor.Final Statement:The Echo Studio undoubtedly stands out as a top-tier smart speaker, offering an unparalleled audio experience with Dolby Atmos and spatial audio processing. While its size, price, and learning curve with Alexa may be considerations, the exceptional sound quality makes it a worthwhile investment for audio enthusiasts. I highly recommend the Echo Studio for those who prioritize an immersive and high-fidelity audio experience in their smart home setup.","Reviewed in the United States November 9, 2023",AFVLIAEZUT352MSUCI5JDEBREIMQ,True,8,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R1HJ6R7ENNCC2G,B07G9Y3ZMC,3.0 out of 5 stars This is NOT the sound you were looking for,n0nuf2,3,"Good day Amazon!So, I've had a pair of Gen2 Echo+ and Echo Sub for some time. I like overwhelming bass in all music; I don't want to have the volume on +10 to feel the bass. The Echo 6"" sub is decent for what it is. I have the two Echo+ and Sub stereo grouped with FireTV Cube for 2.1 sound while watching TV (only from FireTV). Sounds very good for what it is. Now I've purchased 2 Echo Studio speakers as well in hopes the larger drivers will 'fill' the bottom end. Honestly, if you like your head ripped off by too much midrange (1K, 1.2K, 5K, etc), then these are for you; The Studios have no 'heart'. I used to run sound for our band and I know when there's too much of something in the mix; FWIW. I turn the Studio mids all the way down -6 and drop the treble to -2 and set bass to +6 then the Studios sound just 'ok'. So, I paired my Echo Sub with the Studios to see if that balances it out. Nope... No matter what I set the EQ to or turn spatial on or off, makes no difference with any kind of music (3D or not). The Studios actually attenuate the sound coming out of the Echo Sub. Far less bass paired up with Studio than Echo+. I'm seriously considering returning the Studios and getting 2 more Echo+ and another sub. (all of this stuff would benefit from more user EQ and crossover adjustment). In a final attempt to get 'MY' preferred sound out of all of this I created an Echo+ stereo pair with the Echo Sub, then just stereo paired the Studios together, set all EQ accordingly, then created an ""Everywhere"" group out of all of that. In that configuration the Studios aren't attenuating the sound from the sub. One would think that the size of the drivers on the Studio would trump the Echo+ as far as low end, but nope. W/e these things are doing is wrong IMO. It is true that Studio is clearer than Echo+, but to what end? Not a good one IMO... When I turn the EQ to +6 Bass, I expect the thing to thump (within reason for a 4""+ woofer). If I had a wish it would be that Amazon Echo releases an 8"" 800+ watt Echo Sub (with a decent user adjustable EQ) so those of us who LIKE the low end more than screaming mid range can manually shape the sound and get the sound they want. All in all, after trying high-end Apple, Sonos, Google, Bose and a few other expensive options side by side (yes, bought them all at the same time and tried at same time, then returned the others), the Amazon speakers sound the best, and are the clearest. (By the way, don't believe what you hear in the store or the sound demos... The acoustics are NOT the same as the environment YOU will be using them, and their ""demos"" are adjusted to make 'their' device sound better than it is with real music). I wish I knew where to post this comment that Amazon team would read it; probably wouldn't matter. LOL. All aforementioned devices have been tested on a 400GB connection with Amazon Music, Google Music, Pandora, Spotify, several other streaming services, as well as Bluetooth music from multiple devices. Agree/Disagree, there's my experienced 10 cents worth opinion for anyone considering these devices.I own a LOT of Echo devices and can't wait for new better Echos to be released. I just hope the Studio is NOT where they are going in the future... Don't get me wrong, it's a nice speaker, but not everyone wants screaming mid range. Example, most everyone I've EVER met uses a "" V "" or "" W "" configuration in their EQ. That represents CUTTING most of the screaming mid range.

We love that you can control the hdmi ports and everything with the cube remote/alexa by telling her. I Think its awesome, you want to play video games alexa switch to hdmi 3, ok.So in the mornings getting the family ready for the day, and when I am working from home I love to have the news on in the background. I notice news12 app doesn't work (local live news app) , do everything, delete cookies, cache, delete redownload the app. So im like EFF IT, put on sling, I Guess im effen stuck with fox/abc, well those won't work with live tv either! wait look amazon has a live news app, download that, oh look that doesn't work either. I factory reset the cube, reset everything back up still doesn't work, even tried hard wiring the cube to the internet to make sure it wasn't our wifi (even though we have 2 fire sticks, and a tv that are working fine with all the apps and live tv). Still doesn't work.Speak to amazon they work me through everything, still nothing works, they send me a new cube. Set it up, didn't connect it to the speakers, live tv works fine, HOOOOOOOORAY LOOK AT THIS LIVE TV WORKS FINE! Now I can catch up on this whole coronavirus news lmao. Time to set up the speaker group (I mean I just spent $600.00 on amazon speakers to use with the tv/music I mine as well use them) . Live news worked for literally 5 seconds, then freezes. We reset the router, hardwire it, update it, delete cookies and did a little dance and said some prayers around it, still nothing worked for live tv. My husband swears its some kind of cube bug maybe that live tv just doesn't work with it, I said ehh maybe its the speaker group (2 amazon echo studios and subwoofer which happen to be the reason I even bought this god damn cube). I forget the group, live tv starts right up.In my opinion this should be a glitch worked out before making people buy this device to work with all of these expensive amazon speakers. Some might even be like why do you need stereo surround sound to watch to watch the news? I don't.. but what about sports events, or if I decide to watch a show when it airs instead of pre recording? none of that works. So in a weeks time I spend about $650.00 on an amazon entertainment system that doesn't work. I was already upset that I couldn't hook up a bluetooth device to my entertainment group (I would like to play records on the 2 studios and subwoofer) and can't do that, but now this? Amazon please come up with a resolution asap. Once you do, let me know and you will get 1000 stars.","Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2020",AFKDUPX6QR4VIFF2PANI2M5LOLRQ,True,2,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R1M9FLG0AEAAC4,B07G9Y3ZMC,4.0 out of 5 stars *Fixed - Issue with Studio/Sub pair at first but now stellar.,AC,4,"I have a myriad of Echoes around my open-floor plan house including five Echo Subs for whole-home audio but some of my Echos are 1st generation. When this game-changer, Echo Studio came out, I was hoping to up the ante by replacing my old Echoes with a few Studios so I started out with one.First, its greatest feature: the room-measuring, self-adjusting, high-tech “spatial” processing must be disabled in order to hear the highs, at least to my ears. That’s okay since I don’t really care about spacial whatever, I just want to crank it up!One important feature for me is the ability to pair the Echo Studio with my Echo Sub and enjoy the bass from both devices at the same time. After all, for twice the price, I want twice the bass, right? That’s where I ran into problems.I initially setup the Studio and played some tunes which sounded spectacular. Then, I eagerly set up my sub and paired it to the Studio, imagining what twice the bass was going to sound like. The pairing went fine with no hiccups. Then I added the new pair to my “Everywhere” group which also went fine. I played some music on my Everywhere group where the Studio performed well again BUT there was nothing coming out of the Echo Sub it was paired with.I paired, unpaired, paired again, deleted and reinstalled both but the result is the same: the Studio vibrates for all its might while the Echo Sub it was paired with sat completely silent. I was heartbroken, wondering why the Studio would play all the bass and deprive a dedicated Echo Sub from playing any of it!Amazon tech support actually called me to try to sort out the issue and assured me the Studio should, in fact, play nice with the Echo Sub as they have an identical setup in their own testing room. The tech verified on her screen that the Studio and Sub were active and linked together in a sub pair I labeled “TV room sub pair” in the Alexa app.However, I only over tested the setup by playing music on my Everywhere group. The tech asked me to first play music specifically on my “TV room sub pair” and suddenly my Studio and Sub came alive together! Then, I tested music on my Everywhere group again and lo and behold, the Studio and Sub played together, giving me the bass I wanted.I don’t know how or why but I learned: 1. Pair the Studio with the Sub and give the pair a name in the Alexa app, “TV room sub pair” in my case. 2. Ask Alexa to play music, specifically using that pair’s name. It is not enough to just walk up to the Studio and ask Alexa it to play a tune because only the Studio will play and the Sub will sit silent. 3. After playing a tune to ensure the Studio and Sub work together, THEN add the pair to my Everywhere group.Thanks Amazon tech girl!Rock on.","Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2019",AHHUPZU72BOUDIQW4OGLM2OYGX7A,True,8,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

R1O9E196G6AFTV,B07G9Y3ZMC,"4.0 out of 5 stars Sound is fuller, more clear, bass OK, attractive design",Grayslake,4,"Have two of these now. Bought to replace older Echo Dot pancake, plus older Echo cylinder models (reused elsewhere). Sound is noticeably better and more clear. Bass is there, but in a speaker so small bass performance is limited no matter what. At high volume, this speaker gets a bit muddy. At reasonable levels, it has pretty good midrange performance for voices, most music. Higher frequencies are edgy depending on volume. Found setup with Alexa pretty easy and done in less than a minute. Attractive design too. Conclusion: works much better in small rooms for music listening, but otherwise useful in any room. NOTE: initially had connection issues with my second studio speaker. It was no more than 3 feet from the router through a regular drywall wall. It would lose connection or I would get the famous I can’t understand right now message. Found that positioning the unit is everything as far as connectivity. I moved it about 8 feet away against an opposite wall. It connected fine and stayed connected. No dropouts. I think the positioning of the antennas inside of it.

Finally, at the bottom, a serial number UPC!ConstructionThis Motion X600 consists of a three-part fabrication; a handle & grill forged from aluminum on the front with a color-coordinated plastic posterior available in ""Polar Black"", ""Lunar Blue"" and ""Aurora Green""upon visual inspection is difficult to discern where the aluminum metal ends & the plastic begins! Meanwhile, the handle has respectively, ""Spatial Harmony"" & ""High Fidelity Audio"" in block font along the bottom left & right ends of the handle as well as ""Soundcore"" in stylized lettering on the top right. The ridges that aid grip-ability are located in the bottom middle part while the perimeter periphery is smooth. Staying in the back has a unique rubber stop flap which guarantees the X600 its Ingress Protection Level 7 status that enables the speaker can handle H2O from misting & condensation up to an accidential dunk up to a meter for 30 minutes. the rear also conceals a passive radiator, linked to the Midrange ""Sky Driver"" but helps the system sound better via Digital Sound Processing, a USB-C port as well as a 1/8"" auxiliary jack.Driver ConfigurationThe Anker Soundcore Motion X600 Speaker System is a 3-way, quintuple driver powered by 5 amplifiers producing 10-watt RMS for a total of 50 watts RMS configured as twin 2.06"" woofers, duo 1.06"" tweeters & a unique 1.92"" passive radiator augmented midrange ""Sky Driver"" Spatial Driver is controlled by a 12 core Intel i7 12700K processor clocked from 3.6-5.0 GHz, ohm: N/A, Frequency Response: 48-40,000Hz+- 2.84dB, Horizontal Dispersion, 5.49dB, Signal to Noise Ratio: 72dB, Total Harmonic Distortion: <1%, Sensitivity, 92.1dB, Crossover: 54Hz, 2,500 Hz & 19,100Hz, Battery, SW-34MP2S2P; 6400mAh Dimensions: 6.25"" High x 11.75"" Wide x 3.88"" deep, Weight: 5.17lbs.I charged my first Motion X600 with a 45watt Samsung wall charger connected to a 100watt Anker cable taking 4.5 hours to charge while the 2nd X600 was charged using an Anker 30watt wall charger with a second 100watt cable connected to two of the 8 electrical outlets which was done in 5 hours.When both speakers completed their compulsory charging session, on Thursday, December 28th, 2023, most of the scribes advised switching on both the Spatial Audio & Bass Buttons to mitigate its mettle as well as promote the prowess of the Motion X600 otherwise owners would likely feel the engineering savants were snookering them impacting future sales.Eargasmic Ecstasy!That began when I decided to play my 450-song Latino 🎄Carols playlist on YouTube Music designed to tide me over a 13-hour journey from Gastonia, North Carolina to Philadelphia! Once I activated, the 15-segment equalizer, the Spatial & Bass buttons It was 😱WOW!!!, WOW SQUARED!!!!!!, WOW CUBED!!!!!!!!!! 😲 It was as if I heard the music for the first time! for it sent chills through my body to not just the 🦴s but the bone marrow! Which is exactly how good the X600s are! Sibling #6 was as duly impressed with the speakers as he was with my Q60A panel when was deployed 21 months ago! for he considers them Home Theater caliber!This was confirmed on Three Kings Day/Epiphany; January 6, 2024, when after still trying to use the Soundcore app to no avail, it was not only severing The True Wireless Stereo bond but replaced the X600 pairing with the generic LG driver on the TV which necessitated a speaker reset so in despair, I watched ""Terminator; Judgment Day"" & realized how good the X600 sounded as normal solitary speakers when I could readily discern where the various soundtrack aspects occurred via the individual speaker drivers! Once I reset the speaker it started at maximum volume which almost got us reported by the next-door neighbors for bringing the noise! After a successful reset, and recharge (for 7 & 8 hours) which for an idiosyncratic orientation, included playing the YouTube playlist, I watched & thoroughly enjoyed the lush, vigorously robust soundtrack of ""Wonder Woman 1984"" & Quite honestly, What I heard through my 👂holes brought me back to when I had my last CRT, The NEC 2030S & my first LCD panel, the Samsung LN-T1954 when TVs had enough space to include decent stereo sound to match their displays!The Soundcore AppIt's an authentic atrocity that this program is oriented toward audio music when the Motion X600 itself can adapt itself to Audio/Video Home Theater & worse yet when I called Anker Innovations Tech Support on January 2nd, they confirmed its bias toward record collections because every time I endeavor to utilize its features, it shut down the TRUE WIRELESS STEREO facet which is the reason why I strived to save the >$200 more to score the second speaker! which rendered the other speaker as mute as a mime, furthermore, the app caused more agita by making it more problematic to pair with my Samsung Q60A panel! I sincerely wish and desire that this Cucaracha is finally fumigated from future updates ASAP! STAT! In addition from December 28th, 2023, when I first tried to establish a legitimate Soundcore Account it wouldn't recognize it even though I followed the procedure precisely to the letter!ConclusionI'm happy that the operation of these Anker Soundcore Motion X600 speaker systems isn't dependent upon this program because they sound incredibly amazing, augmented by its uniquely innovative design & technologies both external & internal, its configuration and price. And the President Grant-sized discount on top makes it even more of a steal of a deal!Addendum: Monday 12 February, 2024One of my pet peeves with my pair is that I had to sync it with the YouTube Music account before working successfully with my panel; for the past month after subsequent charging sessions, that weirdness has vanished. Both speakers hook up normally, provided that the owner/operator powers them in the proper sequenceAlso, I acquired the 45-watt Anker 313 wall charger for the 2nd speaker to have them fully charged & ready at the same time enhancing my satisfaction with these speakers.","Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2024",AHR2HVADX4IGRM7V267GYCXJMM5Q,True,15,Color: Black

Ramping up the volume does not distort the music. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.Soundcore stands by their products.

RI9EV9603R8U0,B0BXW4KKXK,4.0 out of 5 stars The other reviews are not joking!,Jerry Kindall,4,"The most important thing about any Bluetooth speaker is the sound. I am rather picky with audio quality and most products need some tweaking to meet my standards, and some can't meet them at all. This unit has very good sound, especially at close range. It turns up pretty loud, too (to fill a room you only need to turn it up to the second or third notch) and does a fine job outside when cranked up sufficiently. Of course the louder you play it, the shorter the battery life.The pairing is easy; just turning it on for the first time activated pairing, and my Pixel phone immediately recognized it without me even having to choose it in the list of devices available to pair. That process prompted me to install the app as well. Very slick.The app is good and has some unexpected nice features (for example, you can play/pause whatever app you're using to actually play music from the Soundcore app, so you don't have to keep switching back and forth). It feels more polished than the one LG provides for its XBOOM Bluetooth speakers, for example.The default ""Soundcore Signature"" equalization curve is good, and shows off the speaker's capabilities nicely, but you can also tweak the equalizer however you like. When you turn up the treble it's really there, sounds natural and not tinny or distorted. Same with the bass, which is solid and not boomy. It's not one of those bass enhancer things that uses psychoacoustic principles to give the impression of more bass; it's really there and it can rattle the table.As far as i can tell, the EQ and spatialization features are functions of the speaker itself; the app is not doing the audio processing on the phone, just changing the speaker's features. So once you have the speaker set up the way you want, you could remove the app. Speaking of the spatialization, it's reasonably effective at close range but if you're across the room from it, it doesn't do much, as you might expect. I haven't tried spatial audio on it, though, just stereo.This product shows a pleasing thoughtfulness and attention to detail all the way around, from build quality to the app to the sound. On Prime Day the price was certainly right and I'm glad I pulled the trigger.","Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2023",AGIY3WBHRMCHOY2SY2527UBYGZWA,True,44,Color: Black
R3MHT3B4OBZW54,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Quality Speaker,@SteveG,5,"I had bought Anker ear buds last year which were excellent for the money so when I was looking and saw this speaker with a $50 coupon and high ratings, I pulled the trigger and ordered it without much thought. Being a musician who usually takes about 3+ months of research to buy any piece of audio equipment, this was a big step for me LOL.All I can say is that this speaker has been great so far. It's a very cool, clean, modern looking speaker. The construction feels solid and durable and having the handle to carry it around from place to place is more of a plus than I thought it would be. The sound quality is excellent, bass is very good at low to medium volumes but gets lost a bit when you really turn it up (or that could just be my aging ears), and it is loud! I didn't notice any significant distortion at high volumes and the overall clarity and presence of the individual instruments was very good. I tested a variety of musical genres (jazz, rock, pop, punk, ska, hip hop, rap, classical) and all sounded good to great.The Anker app is great and gives you more flexibility with the EQ settings as well as showing the battery level of the speaker. The voice prompt when you power on/off isn't obnoxious like some other speakers I've heard, it's just a tone but you can also turn it on and off in the Anker app. Since I already had the app for my earbuds, I just needed to add the speaker to my devices in the app (click of a button) and I was good to go.The battery life seems solid. It does take a while to charge fully (about 6 hours) but from what I read you can charge while using it in a pinch, but you shouldn't do that all the time or it can cause damage to the battery. I tend to listen at a fairly loud volume most of the time and after listening to music for about 4 hours using the BassUp and Spatial features on, the battery level is still showing as about 60%-65% so I'd expect to get about another 6-8 hours before I have to recharge.In short, I am very happy with the speaker and would definitely recommend it.

I own several pairs of Sennheiser headphones and the quality of the Soundcore seems comparable to the best of them in my opinion, of course it is a speaker not a headphone. One of the reasons I got this was so my wife would have a speaker to play stuff through and I wouldn't have to listen to a tinny iPhone speaker struggling for dear life.I thought the spatial audio thing was a gimmick but it's like some sort of magic. You have to hear this speaker in person to believe it. Online video reviews don't do it justice.Music is balanced and crisp. Listening to a podcast is like the host is right in the room with you talking. It's amazing.Other pros include having an AUX input for redundancy and better quality than Bluetooth (although even on Bluetooth this speaker sounds great). I like that it's waterproof so I can take it outside or keep it around when doing home renovation projects and not worry about my speaker. Battery life is great, and in my experience I get more than the stated 12 hours, which may be due to some of my use being at a low volume (playing instrumental music on my desk during the work day).This speaker looks sleek too!

As an audiophile once told me ""If it doesn't make you want to register to all your favorite music then it isn't the right equipment for you.""I agree. I wanted something that could sound could in an apartment but still give me depth and width and clarity. After watching a lot of youtube reviews I took the plunge.I was ready to be not that impressed, especially having had all the equipment listed above and and not finding an emotional connection to music through them.Well Sonos and Bose can suck it. This little speaker is better tuned for clarity than any of them and the dsp to simulate spatial audio is A+. I listened to tons of music 80s and 90s rock mostly. The clarity is very good and vocals come up out of the top speaker. I was astonished to hear guitars separated out in 3d.You will want to be in a square room with the speaker in the center so the spind bounces off the walls.I'm really thinking about negating a second to create a stereo pair. But honestly even just 1 speaker sounds amazing.It really makes me wonder why anyone pays for Bose or Sonos. I have annadrpid and you use the LDAC and youtube music and it sounds great.If Soundcore ever makes a soundbar I will probably buy it. Although I did you this to watch Manhunter on Amazon and paired it to my tvs bluetooth. Voices where clear and the soundtrack was awesome.It's really rare to be happy with a bluetooth speaker imo.

The x600 is no different - the design is excellent and the plastic housing with metal handle feels well built. The sound, despite my expectations failed to live up to the HD audio certified tag and ultimately despite trying to fine tune I wound up returning the speaker. For its size, the bass is punchy when placed properly, the mids are a bit drowned and the highs get crunchy at time due in part to the spatial top speaker. Let me say that it is an interesting design and I hope they continue to pursue perfection on this because atmos/3D/360 audio is game changing as I listen on my 9.2.4 atmos theater system daily while working. This speaker however misses the mark, when the spatial is disabled the speaker gets muted severely. Missing highs and rumbling bass are all you get from it and for the price it doesn’t fulfill expectations. While the tiny speaker does impact the sound greatly - a good set of TWS speakers like the reasonably priced soundcore motion+ does a better job of sound stage isolation and frankly you can buy two of those for a price of one x600. Don’t get me wrong, this tech is cool and the speaker isn’t bad per say - it’s just not worth the current price tag of over a hundred seventy usd. It’s a hundred dollar speaker for sure, and you’d be best to spend money elsewhere or pick this up on sale. The associated EQ app is the best in the business and you can get this close to perfection up to medium level volume before the high sound kills the experience.","Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2024",AEU4QM6M252IYJLVIARY3YHJ3KHA,True,11,Color: Blue (Lunar Blue)

R30RILO0W9PEN0,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Very pleased with this purchase!,WMiracle,5,"Clean sound, good bass - IF you adjust it correctly. Get the Soundcore app and do a manual EQ. There are some maps out there on the web for the best set up (I can't remember where I found the one I am using, but I even tweaked that one a slight bit). This thing really is a good value. I enjoy listening to this. Also, I watched the UTube vids by Alan Ross. My experience is very different than his. I don't want a BOOMING, ghetto bass in my music. I want a good, growling, good depth of range that can get punchy when the source presents it as such. I totally get that from the x600. I hate muddy bass! and I don't get it from the x600. A couple of tuning points: 1. Where you place the x600 will effect the sound quality. It still sounds good in the middle of an open room, but sounds better closer to a wall. 2. Make sure to manually tweak the settings via the soundcore app. 3. I only play lossless audio (Flac) through my x600. MP3 can greatly vary in audio quality. I have a fine home audio system that I truly love, but I find myself pulling out the x600 and listening to it more and more. Is it as good as my home audio system? NO! But, it's really enjoyable listening to and I can take it from room to room or out in the garage. The sound is clean, wide, and has a satisfactory bass (more studio style, non-overamped). If you are looking for ghetto bass, you'll be disappointed. I'm tempted to get another x600 so that I can use in stereo sync mode. Also, this is a great TV sound bar if your TV has BT capabilities. Movies sound great through it!

R3057JFHDIMGUQ,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars A round of applause for this outstanding speaker,Wise Owl,5,"I have been a fan of Anker's Soundcore lineup for a while. I have the Flare 2, Motion Plus, Motion Boom, and Motion Boom Plus and while not the best sounding of the lineup it is my new favorite Anker has produced.First off the aesthetics. Except for the Flare 2 I'm used to speakers from them that frankly are rather ugly. Plastic and rubber with a metal mesh grill on the front. What a beauty this speaker is. I own a lot of bluetooth speakers and this is right up there with best. The look and feel of this speaker is just a pleasing all around.Of course if I bought speakers just for the looks I would likely not own what us arguabley one of the best affordable speaker brands out there. The Motion Plus has some of the best mids and highs, but lacks bass. The Motion Boom has the best bass of any speaker for its size, but is lacking on the highs. The Motion Boom Plus combines those two to deliver what I would consider the best sounding speaker of the lineup. The only speaker I think sounds better than the Boom Plus at its size would be the Tribit Stormbox Blast. Anything better than those cost twice the price and are a bit larger. Going a size down my favorite would be my JBL Charge 5.So where does this speaker fall? Well I would say it is a larger Motion Plus with bass that comes very close to the Motion Boom. It doesn't match up to the Boom Plus but it is also half the size. If we compare to my favorite speaker one size down the Charge 5 it destroys that speaker. I saw some reviews claiming this speaker lacked bass... No it definitely does not. It may not hit quite as hard as the M Boom, but that like I said has the best bass of absolutely all bluetooth speakers at its size and the gap here is very small. Suggesting it has less bass the the Motion Plus though could only be possible if their X600 is defective.Lastly the reason I'm a huge fan of Soundcore speakers is honestly because they have the best eq software out of any bluetooth speaker brand I have come across. You can truly tune your speaker to sound how you want it to with a tremendous amount of control. Most custom eqs have little change to the speaker. I mention this because except for maybe the Motion Boom Plus I have not had any speaker that sounds it's best with the standard Soundcore Signature tuning and this speaker is no exception. Out of the gate it is lacking a tiny bit in mid bass which might be what the other reviewers are complaing about with lack of bass as most speakers are mid bass forward. Even my Charge 5 had a little more mid bass out of the gate, but this trumped it on sub bass. You can even crank up the sub bass but too much and this speaker can't handle it and becomes a bit distorted at higher volumes.Overall this is hands down the best looking and nicest sounding speaker you will find at this price point. There is no smaller speaker that sounds better, so if you want better sound you will have to go larger. I highly recommend!","Reviewed in the United States May 14, 2023",AFLUZV54ZUQSQ3YSXRWXCSEU5JSA,True,76,Color: Black

Being able to enjoy my favorite tunes at a reasonable volume while staying focused is a true pleasure.I am pleased to report that this speaker exceeded my expectations! Upon unboxing it, I was struck by its larger size compared to what I had anticipated. While smaller than an 80s lunchbox, it certainly had a more substantial presence than I was accustomed to. I connected it via Bluetooth to my laptop while keeping it plugged in (I prefer to have my electronics connected unless I specifically need them to be portable), and I was immediately impressed by the quality of the sound emanating from it as I streamed music from YouTube Music. The volume was so robust that I had to dial down my laptop's volume to 60%.The speaker's bass was just right—not overwhelming—and there was no distortion even when the volume was maxed out.Should I wish to switch to Bluetooth on my phone and bring the speaker outside while barbecuing or cleaning my truck, I can simply carry it outdoors and continue enjoying my favorite tunes.In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend this speaker—it is definitely worth the price.""Big"" Henry Approved!","Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2024",AEGHZHKDHSDLIT5OSLMQMHPAPJEA,True,10,Color: Black

Battery life/capacity NEEDS a massive upgrade. Currently it works for 10-11 hours on 50-60% volume with BASS + Sound Boost enabled.2. Slightly on the heavier side so not as easy to carry around3. SBS performs much better indoors due to sound bouncing off the walls (tested in a 200 sq. ft. room).4. 50% volume fills the room quite well with SBS5. Hate the rubber flap (not in pictures) at the back, covering USB C/AUX port. It's added for water proofing but over the years that rubber will get brittle and break off. I would have preferred SoundCore using independent plugs for each port which could be user replaceable.6. Bottom rubber feet could be much larger for better grip, it's sufficient for now, but even a slight incline 10-20 degrees, and I feel the speaker will fall flat due to rumbling from BASS at higher volumesPROS:1. Great build quality.2. Premium quality materials used3. Got it at a 50$ discount which placed this product as a must buy, the pricing was perfect during black friday sale.4. SBS is a great feature that no other speaker provides at this cost. It seems gimmicky, not truly 3D audio, but it does a great job in filling the room5. BASS on this is ridiculously outstanding. I'm not a huge fan of thumping audio, but I can say that this is quite good.6. Audio doesn't crackle even at 80-90% volume levels, but it will be tested with times. I doubt I'll even use it above 30-40% levels.7. 50W speakers, apparently louder than most budget televisions that come with 30-40W speakers inbuilt.Overall, if it's at a $50+ discount, go with this blindly if battery capacity is not an issues.For me, this is my main speaker for my laptop and is used 12+ hours a day so have to charge daily which is cumbersome.

Sound quality is beautiful and setup wasn’t too difficult. You do need the app to fine tune the sound and that is necessary depending on the room, the music, and your personal preferences. However there are a few things to consider:1. If using in the bedroom you will need to get LED covers for the top buttons as they are very bright. But it does make a good night light if you need it. It will automatically shut off after a period of time it does not receive a signal. You can set that time via the app.2. The app has 4 brightness adjustment for the buttons! Nice!3. The usb C charging cable is ridiculously short, so save yourself the headache of trying to find a way to charge the device 6-inches from an outlet and purchase a longer cable.4. No charger included and no clear guidance in the instructions on ones that will work. I had an old iPhone 5V/3A USB C charger and checked with Soundcore customer service (which is great) and they confirmed it was safe to use for charging. Used it on a six hour charge via an outlet (not a power strip) and it worked just fine.5. Definitely play with the EQ settings in the app - you can adjust the bass if the surface the speaker is on resonates too much, or just tailor the sound to your ears.6. A 6-hour charge for only 12-hours playing time is a kinda poor, but the sound quality outweighs that issue for me since mine will always be near an outlet.7. Speaking of which, the Soundcore FAQs recommend the speaker NOT be used while charging. This is not in the QTG or additional instructions.8. I understand there are differences in the available spatial sound options in the Android app vs the Apple app. Check to see what the differences are for your device.Are these enough to return it? Heck no! The sound quality is great. The build quality is solid. It totally meets my needs and I have enjoyed listening to all genres of music.

After my own research, I ended up with the Soundcore Motion X600 Bluetooth & AUX Input (sweet) with the main selling feature is the Spatial Audio. Wow the sound of Soundcore really delivers an amazing sound especially the BASS when playing Techno music sounds. The volume from my IPad is set to 75% and my daughter can still listen it from the second floor . Bluetooth pairing is easy peasy with both Apple products (IPhone & IPad) and PC Windows 10.What I don't like with the SoundCore Motion is the short battery life when using the BASS , short USB-C cable charger, and no indicator when battery is low ONLY a red light blinking on the power button. I know this might be a minor dislikes for the price paid, but it's still a keeper for me & no regrets here.","Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2024",AEHKLC7PW4CTK7VAZ6YFDLBD7LSQ,True,2,Color: Black
R1V430Z8TGBDGN,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Speaker – Would give 10 stars if it were possible!!!,Orion_EJ,5,"For context I have had the Bose Soundlink II, a superb speaker, for about 10 years but my teenage son recently commandeered it so this is a replacement. There wasn’t a new version of the Soundlink II on the market just other Bose products (e.g., Soundlink mini II and revolve) that did not fit the bill so I decided to see if there was anything else on the market. I listened to the Sony XGR 300, Sonos Era 100 and B & O Beosound explore. Short story the Sony was very good all round (nice bass kick and volume), but did not have the clarity and sound quality of the X600. Also, the Sony design was not as sophisticated as the 600X. The Sonos ERA 100 was very neutral (bass was not deep enough and treble not high enough). Also, the design was somewhat generic and it lacked the stereo separation of either the Sony or the 600X. The B&O while in a similar price range did not play as loud and got distorted very quickly when you raised the volume which was surprising for a B&O product. Also, bass sounded very puny…probably best for small applications like replacing a set of headphones as it was completely out of its depth in this comparison. The 600x was clearer, had a huge soundstage and by far the deepest and cleanest bass punch. It is actually a big improvement from the excellent Bose Soundlink II. The construction feels solid, the design is sleek, and it sounds absolutely fantastic much like a bigger stereo speaker. I have played Jazz, Electronica, R&B, trap beats, Afrobeat, and other genres through the 600X and everything sounds insane! Just listened to Trappist Nights - Geotheory, Donald Byrd – Flight time, and Maxwell – reunion and I am hearing things I haven’t heard before.. very impressive! Two tips:1) Download the Soundcore app and use the custom EQ setting to tweak your music as desired. I read through some of the low rated reviews including a user who said the EQs made no difference and it really makes you wonder. There is a very clear difference as you move through the different EQ presets not to mention using the custom setting to tailor your sound (see pictures)2) Leave the Mega bass and spatial sound buttons on (see picture) and be wowed! Your ears and eyes will need some recalibration before you believe that what you are hearing is coming from a speaker of that size!","Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2023",AGZ7F7J3NF34YHRWN753LCZRYVPA,True,71,Color: Black

Great for music and watching movies on the go.The construction of it is high quality and premium feeling. Everything is metal and the soft touch rubber feels quality.

When played even at reasonable levels this does not fail to completely surround you in all the layers of music, and wow this thing gets LOUD. Even at 50% volume its just loud enough.App functionality is basic, but it does enough. I like the ability to turn it off right from the app. I also like the ability to save custom EQs.I’ve charged it maybe once since having it and I use it quite a bit. Takes awhile to charge, but thats expected with such a big battery and for it being as large as it is its pretty quick.

RL5G7JAR02X08,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars This Speaker is Totally Satisfying,SBF,5,"I have a 7.1 media room at home and use audiophile quality IEMs with a dongle DAC when lounging in bed or when I travel - I absolutely love music. I had never explored owning a portable Bluetooth speaker - I guess I've been too old school thinking wired sound is the only way to go. My sons use Bluetooth for everything, so I recently started researching wireless speakers and ran across this X600. Reviews were very positive, so I decided to buy one. I've spent a good 10 hours listening to it in less than a week since getting it, and I've become a big fan of this speaker, especially at this price point. It provides a level of detail beyond what I'd expect from a smaller portable speaker, it has a fairly open sound stage from the combination of real stereo separation (a must for me) and the spatial speaker, and it creates surprisingly accurate bass - even at very low volume (another must for me). Deeper sub-bass rolls off, but that's to be expected given the speaker's compact size. Other reviewers have mentioned this, but the heft and build quality of the speaker is really good. Overall, I'm very impressed and happy to add the X600 as a new option to listen to music - bravo.Okay - a brief update on my review. My wife and I recently went out for dinner and had a couple of margaritas. We came back home and she wanted to listen to some music vs. watch TV, so I thought to pull the X600 out and play it. We did some “digging in the crates” on Qobuz playing some old school music in the family room and I cranked this box up more than I had before. I was really amazed - the sound opened up a lot, it was clear, loud and actually did bounce around the family room - it was plent loud for us at 50% volume. Lastly, I couldn’t believe the bass extension I was getting from a speaker this size. I have to say Bravo again!","Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2023",AERFWTLZBSZSD764CW6G5GP6PPJA,True,75,Color: Black

The stock sound is bad, no way around it. Weak bass, lacking clarity in the highs, just a total miss in what seemed to be a new flagship in their bluetooth line.Post EQ? It slaps. Toy with it, don't just use the stock settings, find a signature for your own tastes and you will be rewarded. I'm getting some good deep bass out of the unit now. It's not crazy fast or clean but I'll never expect that from a speaker like this. For what it is, at the price it's at, it delivers the goods. I listen to extreme metal genres so a bad speaker will just fall apart under the stress of trying to keep up with the madness. I'm really impressed with how well this is doing.Spatial audio sounds good on some tracks and bad on others so it isn't a blanket victory in that department, it distorts the sound a bit, so sloppy mixes do come out sounding very rough, but polished tracks sound absolutely fantastic with the spatial turned on, so the wins are just as big as the losses in that area.The build quality is a clear highlight. The metal construction makes it feel like you have something of quality in your hands, the weight removes any sense that you're handling a cheap unit.4/5 simply because this isn't a high price unit and it can't produce a high price sound. It kills in its price bracket, but always understand that you're getting a middle tier bluetooth speaker and it's going to sound like one.","Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2023",AHBQRPRPLGGTWGNWVRX3JQATJHQA,True,13,Color: Black

Plus I never received an answer as to what type I should use. Also no answer from a previous message on messenger. Poor CS I think.Great they have an 18 month warranty (if you can track down CS).The thing sounds great on certain audio. Problem is spatial audio can begin to sound screechy on certain tracks. I listen to a lot of older stuff. If it’s not somehow made to be more modern (think analog vs digital) the thing is more of a nuisance to listen to than a pleasure. Even my AirPods Pro 2 have this issue. It’s a nice thing when it sounds good, but it can drive you batty switching back and forth.Soundcore has cornered the market on the pleasantly made Audio Units that fit a certain budget. They fall well short of upper end stuff, but then again, you get what you pay for.In my particular case I notice the bass is not as clean sounding as something by Bose or Sonos to name a couple.The app has ok sound presets, but it can be a bit clunky to work with. Good thing they include custom EQ as their available four or so are not the best. Better sound is achieved by tweaking the sound. Far better.As I wrote in my title, soundcore is a second level audio producer in my opinion. Think soundesign for those that remember the brand. Needs a boost to be just a bit better, seems adequate at the price point. Unfortunately if you’ve owned any premium stuff, it leaves you empty. No matter how pretty.I have a motion + that I bought a few years back. Sounds as good minus the troublesome spatial audio for half the price. I’d recommend that unit as it has just as good basic sound and most the features it’s prettier sister here has. Plus it seems a bit more durable, but not as pretty with its rubber covering, ipx 7 rating and 12 hr battery time. If you don’t need gimmicky spatial audio in a slightly smaller package, that’s the ticket.If you are a true lover of audio devices that have a real authentic sound to the ear, this device is going to leave you feeling like you aren’t quite sure if you like it. My opinion of course.Good thing Amazon has a liberal return policy as mine is being returned.Wait for something better. I’m sure eventually someone in the higher end game will eventually produce a spatial audio piece. Unless they already have. Portability is a bonus for this unit versus something like the echo studio.I wanted to like it, but it just doesn’t quite have that quality of sound the price commands.

It prepared me for what was to follow.As instructed, I charged it thoroughly before using it, then downloaded the app and started listening. At first, I liked the overall sound; it was bright and had a nice mid-range tone. The bass is good, even excellent, but a bit finicky. The bass is solid and firm if appropriately placed with a wall behind it. Stand-alone, it could be more powerful, but this should be expected with a product this size and price.The app needs more work, the tone controls vary, and minor adjustments don't make much difference, yet they can be detected. I want more range for the equalizer.I also have a Marshall Stanmore, which is a more expensive Speaker. It doesn't have a battery. Compared to the X600, it sounds bland. I am thinking of selling my Stanmore and getting a second X600 for stereo.The problem is that this speaker is in a crowded price category; it should be less expensive. I received an offer to get $50 off, I paid $150, and it's a good value for that price. If I had purchased it for the full $200 price, I would have sent it back.I have found that the microphone is excellent, we use this for group meetings and it picks up sound extremely well, as well as the Bose unit it replaced.Overall, a good speaker with a great battery life, needs a lower price to really stand out in this market.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2023",AHITCP5I5P35JH6CCMQY3JH7XR2A,True,12,Color: Black
R3G6CTTKLQUXX7,B0BXW4KKXK,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent speaker with issues.,Christian C.,4,"This is a good speaker with issues. The design is outstanding with a premium feel. (I got the blue one)So the sound is good with tweaking needed all the time. The speaker is undergoing updates all the time, and each time the sound changes significantly. I’m having issues with the passive radiator distorting or moving in and out at the wrong time proportioned to the woofers, so with bass up on it doesn’t sound good. Spatial mode is basically required, without it, it’s a performance cut, or dull mode. I found that when using custom eq is when my bass distorts. I’m having better luck with good sound with the preset options. It’s crystal clear and pretty bright, and sometimes tiresome. Just find what eq or preset works for you. When using custom eq bass up needs to be off, for me at least. Even though the app says bass up isn’t available when using custom, it clearly has bass up capability’s in custom eq.Overall good good speaker that needs tweaking and updates. Hopefully they will have an update that fixes the passive radiator issue.Alan Ross reviews is a great place to get to know the speaker, and other speakers. He’s easily the best Bluetooth speaker reviewer in my opinion.","Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2023",AEEV3K4NYJBIPSMXR22XSKLNNIZQ,True,9,Color: Blue (Lunar Blue)
R331U0ZFXYWMI9,B0BXW4KKXK,5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely wonderful speaker and fantastic customer support,clinton james,5,"Can’t really go wrong with the x600 by soundcore. There only complaint is a more linear volume control then the very wide step up/down that is between button pushes would’ve appreciated. A software update could easily fix this.The wide soundstage with crisp highs and clear lows are fantastic. Bass is more than adequate and sounds better if left below 6db. Out of the box it sounds better than most anything in its price range, but once the eq is adjusted for your liking.. it’s a great device. It’s on the larger side for a portable, but the handle negates that draw back.. but it’s also small for a bookshelf speaker.. it’s comfortable in the middle. If you can get the x600 for your budget I’d definitely recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2024",AEIARXSNQ2DGM2QJI3EH6SOOHCJA,True,1,Color: Green(Aurora Green)

I purchased a X600 to be able to listen to streaming music when not in main listening room and outside. A few weeks ago I was struck by a car and suffered a broken leg. Unable to ambulate, I could not operate my main stereo system. Enter the X600. I connected it my Bluesound Node 2i streamer which worked great. It will suffice until I’m able to get back on my feet. The second time I charged the X600 all lights were lit on the speaker. The power light which should be “blue” indicating that speaker was 100% charged remained “red”. I tried to reset the speaker per Soundcore directions, no go. Would not connect to Bluetooth either. Very disappointed that in less than 3 months unit was defective. I called technical support who, under warranty, are replacing the speaker after they were satisfied that all steps to fix had been exhausted. Not a good experience! UPDATE: A manager from Soundcore emailed me and indicated they would replace the X600.

R3I00ED9G2RURG,B0BXW4KKXK,4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound and great quality. ! But lacking a few features...,Babblefish,4,"This bluetooth speaker has great sound and the build quality is top notch. This thing has some heft and feels solid. You won't be strapping this thing to your belt though! It will also add a significant amount of weight to a backpack. The bass response is very good, but just as importantly, the treble response is also pretty good. Many of the other bluetooth speakers on the market also have decent bass response but are lacking good high frequency response, which for me is just as important. The ""immersive spatial sound"" is impressive. You can definitely hear the difference between having it on and turning it off.All that being said, in my opinion it is lacking a few important features. There is no battery charge level indication on the speaker itself. You have to have a smart phone and the Soundcore app in order to see the battery charge level. This brings us to the second thing that's missing, a way to plug in an SD card or USB doggle in order to play anything on this speaker. Lastly, it would have been nice if the handle could fold down to lower the speaker's profile and give easier access to the top controls.All in all I like this thing. It has more than enough bass for the type of music I like: Jazz, R&B, Classic Rock, Folk, Classical, Acoustic Guitar. For some music I turn the bass boost off because it's a little too exaggerated. Either that or I use a custom equalizer setting. The highs are nice and defined and the sound of fingers sliding across the strings with guitar music is crisp.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2023",AG73X2YTIQ5QLKV46OLWIR5QM4ZQ,True,6,Color: Green(Aurora Green)

Comes in 3 different colors. Pretty loud for its size. Like that Soundcore is pushing the envelope. The bad. Sound at different volume levels is very inconsistent.The bass response is very low quality unless you're listening at no more than 25 percent volume. The spatial sound can get pretty tiring due to its upper range. With this speaker you are constantly tweaking the eq and the voices don't sound natural. Really disappointed because I own the Motion+ and I really like how natural it sounds. I play the X600 usually with spatial off but had to create a eq to tame the highs when using it. Deeper, better controlled bass would make this a much better speaker. Looking for the next firmware update. Hopefully coming soon. Will update.Update: After 2 firmware updates: This speaker sounds much better now. More natural voices and the highs, mids to mid bass sounds more cohesive. Just a cleaner fuller sound without sounding overly bright. Bass response is better but you can easily overdrive the drivers. Any other problems can be fixed in the custom eq. The expanded eq is even better but you need to know what you're doing. Soundcore has done a good job with the updates and customers looking for a clean crisp sound profile with decent bass will be pleased. A very detailed speaker, Bass heads look elsewhere.

Battery life is ok at around 10-12 hours but there are better out there. Calling this hi resolution audio is pushing it. The spatial sound feature is interesting but nothing to right home about. I can see using this for a workshop, outdoor party, beach etc but not as primary audio. I played this next to my Sony SRS-XB43 ($125 on sale) and my home audio system on Led Zep 1 and Cream Wheels of Fire. The Soundcore does sound a little better than the Sony but not by much. The Sony has much more of a bass sound where the Soundcore is more crisp. They seem equally loud with the Soundcore maybe a little less distorted at high volume. The Sony has about twice the battery life. Both are waterproof so can be used at a beach or on a boat. Would I use the Soundcore for my primary home audio? No, I'd get listening fatigue. Take the $200 and invest in a decent used receiver and speakers and buy a bluetooth receiver to plug in. If you want real hi res for home use stream Tidal directly to a home receiver or play vinyl / CDs. No comparison. Would I buy it again? Maybe. If it was still $150 and if I didn't already have a good quality bluetooth speaker I would. It would be great for a college dorm for your favorite student. It does sound good for what it is. Would I buy it for $200 as an upgrade to my Sony or a similar high quality bluetooth speaker that I already own? Probably not.

R2N9LGOT33J14T,B09NWBZ7T3,4.0 out of 5 stars A Posh Music speaker!,RT - Gadget Guy,4,"B&O makes posh high end audio gear….gear which showcases the most avant-garde design which would be at home in any modern art museum (MOMA indeed has some of the past B&O iconic products in their exhibits). Normally their gear is priced out of the range of normal-average-hard-working folk ($10000 speakers for example), but with this product, you can get to experience a slice of the life of the upper 0.1%!In all seriousness, this is a regular tiny Bluetooth speaker which has a price at least 5X more than your average tiny Bluetooth speaker. So what do you get for that premium? First, the whole shell is made of metal. It feels cool to the touch. It has hard “Type II anodization” on the aluminum shell which will help resist scratches, and should take the hard knocks while it’s hanging off your backpack using the supplied carabiner clip. The speaker is IPX67 meaning it’s water and dust resistant. You can immerse the whole thing into water for a very short period even.Soundwise, this is a tiny speaker so don’t expect much in terms of volume and thump. It will start to distort if you try to turn it up too high (it's not going to fill a large room in your house). It sounds smooth and the tonality is slightly warm (you hear less of the treble and more of the midrange). Deep bass is nonexistent, but there’s just enough of upper bass tones that you can follow the rhythm of the beat. Measurements on other review sites show that it doesn’t reproduce any content below 100Hz. Basically, it doesn’t reinvent any laws of acoustics and still sounds like a small speaker. But the overall sound quality is clean and the tonality is pleasant. it’s a portable speaker that you can carry with you anywhere, so you can have some music while boating, at the beach, hiking, camping etc. It just works!Battery life is good, at lower and moderate volumes, it easily lasts 10+ hours. Controls are simple: power, volume, play/pause/skip forward backwards. It isn’t necessary to install the app but the app is useful because it gives you the exact battery percentage, turn-off the auto-standby feature if you don’t want it, and has some presets to select a different sound signature or alternatively you can fine tune the strength of the treble/midrange/bass precisely by moving around a slider into four quadrants on the screen. I think it sounds fine with the default “optimized” preset. Also as a bonus, you can plug this into your computer with the USB and used it like a wired USB speaker. You can pair two Bluetooth devices to it, which is the norm nowadays.So is it worth it? By the way, I bought this at a 45% discount (check amazon price history for this product) and even though it’s still not inexpensive, I feel it is good value. Even if it had cost more, I would not have been disappointed. I don’t mind paying more for something that feels like it’s going to last, and with B&O, you get some cutting edge design with great sound engineering.This is a 5 star product, but minus 1 star just because I would have liked to have a microphone so that it acts as speakerphone. Also, because of the bluetooth profile, your device won't show the battery percentage on the phone itself, you have to view the percentage in the app. And the sound is good but it doesn't manage to break any laws of physics (not blaming the speaker but I had hoped that it would really stand out among other small speakers of this size with the bag of tricks that B&O geniuses have up their sleeves. The result is merely very good rather than exceptional). So result is 4 out of 5","Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024",AE6TVTGGPRUEMJMSIV5SX6NDA2PA,True,7,Color: NavyStyle: Bluetooth speaker

I have a Harmon kardon gen 1 or 2 Bluetooth that sounds excellent. I have an Audi A 5 convertible with a B and O sound system that is just the best thing ever. I had never heard B and O until I got the Audi. So. Now I have refurbished a vintage travel trailer and wanted some killer sound while I’m camping. It’s a small space so I don’t need anything like the Harmon Kardon. Plus that needs an outlet. So I’m thinking what does B and O offer in a small package? I got this speaker for $118 because of the gray color I guess. It was cheaper than black. I downloaded the app. And with some adjustments to the bass /treble on the app I was able to get a satisfactory sound. Was I blown away. Sadly not. I was expecting a lot more from B and O. Even if it’s just a wireless speaker. It’s not bad by any means. And I guess for the price it’s a good value. I guess I’m comparing it to my Audi stereo system which is just amazing. 🤩 I can crank it to infinity and it’s crystal clear. I like crisp sound that I can distinctly hear all the beautiful components. Is that too much to ask for in a wireless Bluetooth speaker from the infamous B and O? Like l said it’s not bad any means. But I guess my expectations were too high. It can be cranked to a point. But I’d like it louder. Anyway. Just my rambling thoughts.

First bear in mind that not all speakers are for everyone. Speakers are like clothes, perfumes, etc. You choose them according to your tastes but in order to buy the right one (speakers) first you you need to ask yourself a couple of questions. What kind of music do I listen to? What kind of brand do I relate with? What am I expecting of it? This portable speaker doesn’t really have deep bass, TRUE, but it is there. Apart from that, the voicing of it is great. The vocals sound clear and warm and its ability of playing a song with lots of sounds and instruments is great for such a small portable speaker.I own many portable speakers including the Bose revolve+ and I prefer the Explore in most of the cases. Again, if you want a speaker for extreme bass music, this is not the one, but if you like Vocal music, smooth Jazz like Diana Krall you are going to love it.If you want a party speaker this is not the one either, but if you want a speaker that accompanies you during your walks or have it with you in your office or home without stealing all your attention this is the one for you because although this little speaker can get loud it does it with class and without being obnoxious. I love it!I forgot to mention… the build quality is superb!","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2021",AHTT6M246RTYMED7KQD2F2YTU23Q,True,66,Color: Black AnthraciteStyle: Bluetooth speaker

A Bluetooth that last all day and overcomes the sound of a loud diesel tractor is very important to me not losing my mind.Bang & Olufsen is pretty well the gold standard in audio as far as I’m concerned. My BMW has it and it’s the best audio of any car I’ve ever had. This Bluetooth speaker follows that tradition.The design is incredibly compact, elegant and well thought out. The ability to hang it with a carabiner was an incredibly important consideration for me. It’s a beautiful piece of engineering.Performance is exceptional when used with the app which allows fine tuning. It’s incredibly loud, fills a space and has rich audio. Do not care about bass as you won’t get meaningful bass out of a small speaker for the most part. Clear audio is the name of the game and this speaker breaks so many rules. It pushes way above its weight class.Not to mention it’s entirely inexpensive for the performance this bad boy delivers. This is the only speaker you should consider if you remotely care about audio quality.","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2024",AE5O6HEHZOFRXPDQL46BTXEOZHYA,True,7,Color: NavyStyle: Bluetooth speaker

As an avid audiophile with a penchant for high-end audio equipment, I was excited to add this to my collection. The build quality is exceptional, a true testament to the craftsmanship that went into its design. However, when it comes to the volume, I can't help but feel a sense of disappointment. The sound it produces, while undoubtedly of high quality, is a bit subdued for my taste. As someone who values the intricacies and nuances of audio, I expected more power and presence. While I appreciate the materials and construction, the volume, and the bass issue leaves me wanting more. While I understand the need for portability, the subdued volume simply doesn't cut it for me. Music should have the power to fill a space, to move people, and to evoke emotions, and this speaker falls short in that department. It's crucial for me to have a device that can truly capture the essence of my music, and unfortunately, this one falls short in that regard for those reasons I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.","Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2023",AFUJHHCQZAAFBM6YYCAIOHJOIIBA,True,10,Color: Black AnthraciteStyle: Bluetooth speaker
R2OOWD9I530XTQ,B09NWBZ7T3,4.0 out of 5 stars Absolute gem.......but a disappointing low amount of bass,Tim,4,"Let me start off by saying I did a LOT for research on smaller Bluetooth speakers before making a purchase – which includes reading review/articles and listening to YouTube reviews. I currently have a 3rd generation Oontz Angle 3 Ultra that’s I’ve had for 6 years and was in need of replacing – not because it was worn out, but I just wanted something newer and nicer but generally the same size with more power/more clarity. The B&O explore caught my attention right away due to the design and name. The price seemed a bit eye-watering, but I was really attracted to the battery life (a must for me), the design (very modern and durable), and the fact that is wasn’t a ‘smart speak’. I purchased the speaker, and downloaded the B&O app. The app is a MUST if you want ANY bass projection at all. Everything about this speaker is perfect for me…..except for the bass. There just isn’t any bass! Even with the app settings set to product as much bass as possible, the Explore just can’t deliver. Ultimately, this is a disappointment, as the price tag just doesn’t justify the sounds quality. All B&O need to do is add a little more bass for a perfect – if expensive – speaker! A it stands the JBL Flip 6 is the perfect speaker in this category and is only about $100 – so half the price of the B&O Explore. Here hoping B&O will make a Explore 2.0 with more bass, but will retain everything else that makes this speaker so cool.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2023",AHQTQTOQV5PGD55DUMHONIDGOHCQ,True,19,Color: NavyStyle: Bluetooth speaker

The price for this speaker I feel is worth every penny. The speaker does have weight to it. Not too heavy but because it is made out of quality metal it adds weight compared to cheap plastic ones. However that weight provides better sound since there is no rattling like plastic speakers. It’s a great size and looks amazing wherever you put it. It performs great in small rooms but in large rooms if you put it towards the center of the room it really fills the room. The sound is incredible for something so small. The quality of the sound doesn’t change as you turn it even all the way up. I was really impressed at what a clean sound it has. I do move it from room to room and bought it primarily for around the house but have also used it outside and taken it with me. Because it’s metal and looks so good and I want to keep it that way when putting it in a bag I put it in a small case type bag. However I haven’t been overly careful sign it around the house and even dropped it and nothing happened to it. The strap is well made also and really convenient and looks good because it’s well made as well. I had high expectations because the company makes great products but it even surpassed those expectations. I get endless compliments about it and have had friends order one right after seeing and hearing it and they were surprised at the price not being much higher.

But lack of basic functions make it a waste of money, especially as it wastes so much time. It usually powers on at full volume, no matter how volume is adjusted on the device it’s connected to.And adjusting volume from your device is randomly not an option. also you need to download an app to use it at all. If more than one device has it saved, you don’t get to decide which device the speaker will connect to. Mid-play, the speaker will switch to the other device, then in order to switch back, you’d have to forget the speaker on one device or turn off Bluetooth. It takes a very particular situation for uninterrupted and dramatic comedy-free playback.

I used to have a wonderboom and was happy with it until it finally croaked. I wanted something with long battery life, that was waterproof and decently rugged, and that had good sound quality. I initially bought another wonderboom but hated it! I did tons of research because I needed to replace it with something. I bring my little speaker everywhere and use it all the time. I’m so glad I gave this a shot. It’s perfect for my needs. I expected good sound quality, but I think that the sound quality on the Beosound Explore is *great* when you consider where it’s coming from. Everything is super balanced, and the app is useful if you want to do a bit of “fine tuning” to the EQ. It charges via USB-C. And I love that it comes with a little strap and carabiner. I use that all the time, actually, and it’s super convenient. The design and craftsmanship on the whole is stunning, and something I really appreciate. I feel like the machined aluminum casing probably lends to the sound quality this little thing can produce, but I’m not a sound engineer so this is just speculation. I got this for a steal of a deal on prime day - I think I paid like $130. For that price, I don’t think there’s anything better. If this speaker had a microphone, I think that would take it to the next level and make it worthy of some extra cash, but it’s not something I really need. My only two gripes are the design of the top - it collects water since there is a lip around the edge. The other is that it did sound a little “tinny” once when I probably turned the volume up way too much on one particular song - by way too much, I mean all the way up, like 100%. So unless you frequently do that, you’ll probably never experience it.Update 1 year and 2 months later - the speaker has started failing. It is distorting whatever audio I try to play. I have not done anything crazy with this - it’s never been dropped or exposed to any really extreme environments. Super upset as now I need to find a new portable Bluetooth speaker, and I won’t be going with B&O this time :(","Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2023",AG2NJCF7CFJ5FYZFKXRSFHKZR5JA,True,23,Color: Grey MistStyle: Bluetooth speaker

I mainly listen to classical music and popular music.I pick Explore because it has the ability to present the music I love in a very good and pleasant way.Sound quality:Bose’s sound is nice, but it is too emphasized on bass that the music became incorrect. Sonos’ Roam is a close runner-up, but it’s sound is too soft in the bass and too puncture in the middle. Emberton is great for the popular music but for classical music, some wind instruments sound a bit wrong. The A1 from B&Q is surprisingly a bit spread out that the focus went too far. Explore is a small speaker that has the fault of closed up sound that every small speaker has, but it shows the ability to produce a pleasant balance that I love.Functions:The last thing I want is they recording my shower singing in those Alexa/Siri enable smart speaker, so this speaker is best for privacy concerns.I recommend you download the app and play around to find the sound you like!

This isn’t exactly audiophile, but then again, a true audiophile wouldn’t get a bluetoot speaker.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2022",AHFC7JRCT72DQVXW2NJWJDBQYLNA,True,20,Color: NavyStyle: Bluetooth speaker

I’m a musician and I usually don’t want too much of anything, but there is absolutely no bass! And don’t be fooled by the comments recommending to use the app to add more bass, that adds barely anything. So even with blasting the bass on the app all the way up, there is no bass at all. I don’t expect a small speaker like this to have a nice sub level, but having no bass at all, it sounds like only your treble (highs) would play back the music and there is no body to the sound.I still have it 5 stars for overall because they handled the return very professionally.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2022",AGTGRFHWPRAVTBBJJOGPW63T46NA,True,6,Color: Black AnthraciteStyle: Bluetooth speaker

R2N9GZ6YLXIHZ6,B09NWBZ7T3,1.0 out of 5 stars Don’t waste money in B&O crappy products,DMONVE,1,"I recently purchased a Bang & Olufsen speaker, attracted by its sleek design and premium external materials. Initially, I was impressed by its aesthetics. However, my experience quickly soured as the battery stopped working, making it the fifth quality problem I've encountered with a product from this brand.In all honesty, I found this Bang & Olufsen speaker to be disappointing. The brand's reputation suggests top-tier products, but this speaker left much to be desired. The fact that this is my fifth quality problem with a Bang & Olufsen product strongly suggests a recurring issue with their quality control and reliability.While the designs and external materials are undeniably cool and visually appealing, it's clear that the internal components don't match up. When it comes to speakers, the sound quality is paramount, and in this aspect, I was underwhelmed. The claim that older products from competitors like Bose, Marshall, JBL, and Sony perform better and offer superior sound quality even with cheaper exterior materials holds weight based on my experience.In conclusion, I would caution potential buyers to think twice before investing in expensive products from the Bang & Olufsen brand. While they excel in aesthetics, the quality and performance of their speakers may not meet your expectations, and the fact that this is my fifth quality problem with their products suggests a larger issue within the brand. There are more reliable alternatives available in the market.","Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2023",AGR7LJUYQZ5HEIV24E6S6WXHSUTQ,True,12,Color: GreenStyle: Bluetooth speaker

The treble is in no way smooth or clear and the bass is almost inaudible (even with the B&O app tuned for the most bass possible).The songs I used to test this speaker's high and low ranges were:- Nonstop: Drake- Tip Toes: half alive- Natural: The Driver Era- bad guy: Billie Eilish- Correct: MNEK- Old Town Road: Lil Nas X (feat.

R2TB41OYEQ665X,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply great.,Jake,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my entire ownership of this speaker.Time of writing this review is roughly 8 months after purchase, having used this speaker practically every single day since. This was a replacement for a very well-loved but somewhat lacking B&O (P3?) oval-shaped speaker that inspired of few of my must-have features.My key requirements in purchasing a speaker at this price point were:- Punchy, solid bass, with high accuracy, clear playback throughout most of the volume range- Relatively attractive, understated, simple design with ergonomic and intuitive controls- Easily oriented for high quality playback in a variety of different situations (facing sideways, upwards, at angles)- Long-lasting battery without any obnoxious constant playback interruptions informing you of battery life remainingThis speaker delivers on all of these.The bass is incredibly clear, with no horrible warbling and distortion that’s very common with dozens of other similar speakers. The audio playback is very crisp and clear, with no noticeable quality losses. I’m sure it’s not perfect, but it’s more than adequate for 95%+ of people. Even at low volumes, the quality is still extremely high. There is a usable, enjoyable sound at every volume level.The design is simple, but handsome. It does not look obnoxious or out of place anywhere. It is just the right size, not too large to pop into a bag, and not too small as to have low-power drivers with poor sound. Very easy to transport. The squared design makes it very stable on most surfaces, but is still rounded enough not to get caught on things. The controls are very easy to understand, even the multi-device Bluetooth cycling and syncing. I have no complaints.The speaker works well for playback in nearly any position, especially when placed on a table or other nice playback surface. It can be placed facing upward, and the speaker enhances playback for all-around sound. When placed horizontally, the same happens for directional playback. Very impressive stability in a wide variety of situations. Some would consider the lack of a lanyard or string to be a downside for this point, but there is massive benefits to keeping this speaker on a surface.The battery life is incredible. Vastly longer than I had really expected for this speaker. With my personal usage (middle volume range, 2-3 uses a day for 30 to 60 minutes at a time), I usually recharge every 1-2 weeks. Not sure what exactly that equates to in real playback time, but I still find it impressive. The speaker will notify you at 20% and 10% battery level, which is exactly what I wanted. Many other speakers will interrupt playback at 75%, 50%, etc. I’ve not experienced any noticeable battery decay during my ownership, but I have only fully depleted and nearly fully recharged the entire time, with no “filling up” in between.Downsides do exist, but most are inconsequential for me.- The audible indicators that inform you of which device you are connected to can sometimes feel a bit sluggish, especially with long device names.- I feel the price point is still a bit on the high side for the value, but I feel I’ve more than gotten my money’s worth. I just like a good deal.- Volume occasionally spikes very high in certain scenarios when switching between devices, but is fairly easily turned down after a quick scare.I would highly recommend this speaker to anyone in the market for a speaker at this price point. This is an especially good deal on sale. If you’re still reading at this point, just get the damn thing on the way.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AHZBIFMKWWZHILYEIYOSP4AIA37Q,True,230,Color: Black
R2Y3WBHYS3U0M4,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars A premium speaker in a sturdy package.,Reviewer MHM 3-5,5,"I bought this speaker because I wanted a way to listen to music while grilling in my backyard. I had no expectations of it being a “party” speaker or anything of the like.But my goodness. This speaker punched above the weight I expected and what reviewers claim. They say it’s good for less than 10 people. Probably true if in an enclosed space.Outside, standing in the corner of my backyard about 40+ feet away, the speaker volume is at about 60-70% and with the air conditioner droning on I can still hear this speaker, and the vocals are clear, the instruments are clear, and there’s even some punch of the bass. It’s so much more potent than I expected.I actually bought a second one (the one pictured) so I could utilize Party Mode and Stereo Mode, and then these are far better than they have any right to be. The bass shook through the house at about 40% volume, to the extent that my wife actually asked me to return one and get some noise cancelling headphones if I wanted to be blaring music all day. 😂So (for now), I’m obliging and returning one, but honestly, I don’t want to. One of these speakers are great. Two make a great portable stereo system.Now for the feature set. Key selling points for me were:1. Durability. It’s made of steel and silicone, is rated to withstand a dunk in water and dust. You can enjoy this in the yard, on your workbench, swimming, shower, etc. I live in high desert, and the wind blew over these speakers from a table to the ground and they didn’t have a single dent or scratch. Which leads me to…2. The device has sensors built in that detect its positioning, so the sound quality was maintained even if it’s on its back, side, or face down. None of the other products that compete in this segment offer that function to my knowledge.3. Unlike other products that I considered, this sounded good right out of the box. Anker (Soundcore) offers some great competition in this segment, but needs the EQ tweaked to shine. They’re not bad by any means, but I wanted things to just be simple. Power on and go without fuss. Bose delivered that.There are similar products for sure. Ultimate Ears will also let you pair two portables to create a stereo, but it lacked the intelligence that this speaker did.We already covered Soundcore. Tweak with the EQ, save some money, you’ll likely be happy.These speakers do often go on sale, and I purchased mine used (like new) and refurbished respectively. The “Used” unit was actually brand new from Amazon, broke the seals on the box and everything. Far as I could tell, the speaker just rolled around in someone’s trunk unopened before returning. The box had some cosmetic damage but no dents, broken seals, and all accessories were obviously also unopened.Refurbished unit came straight from Bose. Also came with all accessories and literature, just a box that was labeled “Refurbished”. Warranty on refurbished or new are 1 year regardless.I bring this up to encourage you to save some money, reduce some e-waste, and buy secondhand like I did. No judgments if you want to go new of course! But I got 2 speakers, one that was new in reality, essentially $100 off the set, and I didn’t miss out on anything in terms of product or warranty.$150 is pricey for a speaker, but $103 for a Bose speaker is not. Especially one that can literally go for a swim.Four criticisms I’d like y’all to know. First, compression above about 75% volume. Your bass will flatline above this point to maintain clarity of the track as a whole. In reality, that just means you go from a slightly warm tone to a very neutral tone of sound profile. No big deal unless you’re blasting EDM, Hip-Hop, the like. As I said, this little 20W speaker carries enough punch that 70% was more than enough to fill my backyard.Second criticism is no biggie for me, but worth bringing up for those shopping the competition. I didn’t want to fuss with an EQ, but competitors do have them to fine tune your sound. Consequentially, the app is basically useless beyond seeing your battery life and an option on how to do party mode (not required).Third criticism is truly a nitpick, but why do I have two apps for my Bose products? Why do I need one for headphones and one for speakers? Wish Bose would put all their portable speakers and headphones into one app. You could easily knock out criticisms 3-4 by just putting this speaker into the Bose Music app, like my QuietComfort Headphones, and this VERY speaker's big brother, the Soundlink Flex Max, is already there. Why the heck is the Soundlink Flex not in Bose Music, with a basic EQ like the others?Fourth, this uses outdated Bluetooth. No big deal. Pairs easily. But don’t expect to watch movies or game off of this. Latency is too high.Anyhow, enough of that. Go buy one. Or better yet, two. You won’t be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AH5F7QHDE5VKRAMBN43A5WPU4ADQ,True,104,Color: Black

I’m not going to lie, I had low expectations and planned on returning it. After opening it and setting it up, I got to see what the hype was about. Took me a couple hours of listening to figure out if it was a bang for my buck or a waste of money.I currently have the first UE Megaboom that I use daily that I bought back in 2016. It’s loud, has bass and can fill a room. Sadly, the charge isn’t exactly reliable so I was looking for something new. The Bose Link Flex definitely has a great quality sound. It will definitely fill a room. I like to use mine in the shower and acoustically in the shower the bass just sounds amazing!! Speaker actually fell off the shelf from the bass and survived the fall.Now, I listen to just about every genre of music. I found it to sound best with Latin music. Vocals are super clear. When it came to rap music (or music with lots of bass) I found it to sound perfectly balanced when the volume was at about 75%. Above that you’ll definitely still get volume but the bass will take a seat back. I’m used to the UE Megaboom that has 360 sound. While the Bose Link Flex will fill a room, the sound seems more straight forward depending if you want to stand it up or lay it down.Bose App is decent. Doesn’t really have any equalizer setting on there if that’s what you’re loooking for.I got this because it is small enough to pack in a carry on and not take up too much space in my bag. Might I add, it’s almost the same size as my iPhone 14 Pro Max . I can easily carry both in one hand. Easy to say, I’m going to keep this speaker with me. Now let’s see if the battery life is legit. I’ll check back in.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AF35A3ETTRWH62AWEWFQ2GO27VJA,True,14,Color: Green

R3TVEXDLBORXWI,B099TJGJ91,5.0 out of 5 stars 5 Million Stars!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,Caitriona Gillespie,5,"OMG this is the best speaker which is not a huge floor speaker (over 1 foot high) that is part of a massive speaker system. The sound quality is truly impressive for a speaker of any size, & I think that if I bought another one, which I'm seriously considering, it would rival my Kenwood stereo system, which has two floor speakers that are over a foot high each, & the Kenwood amplifier, & the Kenwood 5-CD player. All that stuff is so big that it needs its own cabinet & takes up several feet of floor space. I don't know how the geniuses at Bose have done it, but they have somehow packed all that sound into a speaker less than half the size of a loaf of bread that is also a very appealing shade of lilac that goes with my décor. The Bluetooth connection works perfectly every time, even though I don't have the newest phone out there. I'm so in love with this speaker, the only complaint I have is purely aesthetic & easily fixed- the fabric loop attached to this beautiful lilac speaker is, for some unknown reason, an entirely ridiculous shade of brilliant orange, which clashes hideously with everything. I solved this problem with a dark purple Sharpie marker. That is the only complaint I have. While this speaker comes without any instructions on how to set it up, the set up is so easy, even when you're not a technology person, that I set it up myself with no help in under a minute. I plugged it in, turned it on, turned the volume all the way up- for some idiotic reason, it comes with the volume all the way down- & then turned on the Bluetooth on my phone & had it search for Bluetooth devices. My phone found the speaker very quickly, paired with it without issue, & started playing. One important thing to know is that when you leave the range of the speaker for an extended period of time, like when I leave for work & take my phone with me, the speaker will turn that connection off, so that when I get home & want to use my speaker again, I need to go over to the speaker with my phone & push the power button once. The speaker will say how much battery power is left & that it is now connected to my phone- I don't turn the Bluetooth off on my phone when I leave the house. I recommend turning the speaker all the way up & then controlling the volume through your phone, which is what I do. I think that's the easiest way to do it. One charge of the battery lasts a long time- at least 12 hours, so that part's great as well. Just buy it already, you won't regret it. It'll beat the pants off of all of your other speakers, even if you already have a nice set of Bose speakers.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AGKOCRUHY2FG2ZHWTZRUH5JYIFBA,True,19,Color: Chilled Lilac
R2TT1UU35P8I2W,B099TJGJ91,"4.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly loud, no EQ controls, few caveats",Jacob Teeler,4,"Bought this for work (I run a forklift and JBLs just arent loud enough) and was pleasantly surprised by how loud it gets. Sound quality is fantastic at all volume levels, its durable and holds up pretty well to the elements. The battery does genuinely last a full 8-10 hour shift playing constantly. A few things to note however.There are no EQ controls for it. Sound is well balanced but theres no bass boost, treble, no nada built in.The app is unnecessary once you get it set up with your device, really only need it to check the battery. The speaker will tell you what its battery percentage is if you turn it off and on though.Max volume is entirely dependent on the device its paired to. If i pair it to my PC, max volume is pretty quiet. If i pair it to my buddy's phone it gets pretty loud, but nowhere near as loud as it is paired to my phone.Volume controls are independent from the device and speaker. You can turn your speaker volume to max but your device is the primary control. So if you have the speaker on low volume and your phone all the way to the max, it wont be as loud as both at max, and vice versa. Its very odd.It does not remember the bluetooth volume of the device its paired to, so if you turn it off and use it the next day, it has a habit of being at full blown volume by default. Just be mindful.Other than that, its excellent and no one will be disappointed by it.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AHEGWVGORT2NYKVPVFMFBFDUYI7Q,True,2,Color: Black

So it’s not surprising that they pack a lot of quality into this little speaker. For one thing, holds a charge a long time! And it announces each time it’s turned on how much charge is left. No guessing. The sound quality is really decent for the size of the speaker. It can get very, very loud, if that’s your thing. It has a bass booster that I usually leave on. I appreciate that it is water resistant as I take this into the bathroom, the kitchen, camping, etc. It paired readily with my iPhone.

All instrumentation comes though nicely while the vocals are crystal clear. The drums of ""In the Air Tonight"", the guitar solo of ""Comfortably Numb"" and the vocals in ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" want for NOTHING.Half volume is more than enough for me in our lounge with the speaker on the far side of the room.I am a bit ""Technically Challenged"", but pairing the speaker up to my iPhone is a breeze.I can recommend without hesitation.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2024",AFOHJOWNEYYE4JNELZNAYYDQ733A,True,0,Color: Chilled Lilac

It was always saying the speaker disconnected even though it was still playing. The app let me turn off the voice prompts. Then I found the actual user manual online and discovered an alternate method:Press and hold + and - simultaneously until you hear “Voice prompts off.”It sounds pretty good, but I mosty use it for voice.It doesn't matter how it is oriented; it still sounds good.But the material that it's made of is messy. It picks up dust and dog hair way too easily.

RMUYYKJ5WTA8Q,B099TJGJ91,4.0 out of 5 stars The sound is awesome but...,HB,4,"It's a Bose so I expected high quality audio and the speaker does that. It's compact and that's part of the issue. It tips over very easily as the base is rather narrow. Second, the battery life leaves a bit to be desired. It's not as long as other speakers I have had but it's decent. I wish the bright white/blue lights were red or could be turned off. It gives off just enough light to be bothersome if you truly need a dark room to sleep. Forget using the app, all it does is connect and you don't really need it to even do that. It wouldn't control anything on this speaker. Lastly, why is it talking? I don't need it to tell me the battery level or that my device is disconnected. I don't need it to speak at all. It's rather annoying bc if you disconnect and don't turn it off, it promptly reminds you. Spooked the hell out of me several times. It gets 4 stars bc audio wise it's absolutely on point as expected. It's the little details that are missing that list a star. Would I buy again?

R36YHGL95K3QBJ,B099TJGJ91,3.0 out of 5 stars there’s a time and place for it!,Steven Jerome Staten II,3,"I purchased this because water broke my old Bose Revolve+. I don’t consider myself an audiophile, but I do listen to music religiously — 100k+ hours annually — and I can appreciate a crisp sounding speaker with nuance. This speaker lacks the nuance. It’s not terribly loud in my opinion, even on full volume in my small apartment. However, it is durable, and I love that it’s waterproof. Upon further research, I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money — many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand, as these speakers can be made for less than $50 and sold for $400+. Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex (product listed here) as well, in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment.After doing some research, I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well. I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use, and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling, as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant. I purchased this on Prime Day for $99 before tax. I would NOT say it’s worth $150 full price. The battery is not great. I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over. Mediocre in performance overall.It’s worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon, the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose “RETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS.” I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers. Keep that in mind!","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AGCXGALSGPD6TVVAU6JWGT6SY4FA,True,3,Color: White Smoke

I'm a klutz and I expect I'll knock this over or to the ground at any point. Does not seem sturdy in that capacity. Otherwise it's a thick and dense little speaker.Functions as it's supposed to. Charged well when I got it. I can hear it from the other room when I walk away and it's got a nice clear quality to the speaker so far. The charging cord that came with it was quite short but functional. The speaker and instructions are insistent about downloading a useless connection application. Seems like another way to advertise more speakers or to sell user data. It was irritating enough, I almost rated this less because of it.Speaker will not connect to my phone via Bluetooth unless I allow the speaker access to contact information. What a dubious and unwanted feature. Also almost rated less than 4 stars for this.We will see about the value for the money over time.

I hope it holds up.We really wanted to love this speaker as we were using it for watching movies outside, however after a month or so, the speaker stopped being useful as it just drops the Bluetooth. We have tested the computer that we use with the older speaker we have, no issues. Than we connect this speaker and sure enough after 5-10min Bluetooth connection gets lost. With that said, when it worked, speaker was very clear and nice.. but now it’s useless. In other words, I would not recommend this speaker because it doesn’t last, and for its price, you should at least get 1 year of usage and not 1 month.

The sound is surprisingly good, and it's quite portable. The dual-bluetooth pairing is also interesting, though can sometimes result in unexpected hijacking of phone audio if someone unexpectedly turns it on and your phone is paired. All good though.Unfortunately, it started refusing to charge, only flashing a single white LED when plugged in. I've tried multiple chargers and nothing will take. It acts like it's charging, but even after 48 hours it still quickly gives a ""busy signal"" sound and powers itself off after you turn it on, which the internet tells me means the battery is too low.Fortunately the unit is somewhat reparable from what I've read. There are ifixit guides out there, and if you don't mind soldering you can relatively painlessly replace the battery.

When I found out it could do TWS by adding a second, I bought another. It took the whole rig to the next level and still came in cheaper than its competitors. I’m only out approx $200 and got a portable water resistant stereo system that I could easily annoy the neighbors with. So far more than worth every penny.Edit: it’s rare for people to give updates months in that are positive. I have used these things for barbecues, birthday parties, hanging out in the yard with the family and even working on various projects in the garage. 100% would buy these thing again.

It’s just kind of “eh” and because it’s built like a JBL but without the quality components it sounds very hollow and echo-y which kill off the deep bass and muffle the highs. Those passive radiators aren’t just for show on JBL speakers but you get the sense these are.

R2IK77E0Q7YTWP,B07QK2SPP7,5.0 out of 5 stars Might be small but awesome speaker!!!,donna jenkins,5,"My husband bought one of these JBL flip 5 Bluetooth speakers when he was out of town working so his work crew could listen to music while working. Well when he came home I borrowed his to take to work, I am a nurse at a small nursing home and my residents love to listen to music they will come out of their rooms and sit at their doorways so they can hear my music from my flip 5 speaker that I sit on top of my med cart in the hallway and all my residents can hear such great quality music from such a little device. I will even dance in the hallway with them even if they are in wheelchairs or can stand. It is amazing what some good peppy music does for even the elderly people, I can see their whole attitudes change and the smiles on their faces are priceless. One resident that recently passed away from COVID, was sitting in her doorway months ago as I had my flip 5 on and music playing and I asked her who was her favorite musician or song and I like to fell out when this elderly Caucasian female said Michael Jackson and song was Billie Jean so I looked it up on my phone and played it for her and she was in a wheelchair but she still patted her foot to the music and tapped her hand and fingers on her table and at times I could hear her singing along and this made me so happy to do this for her we had a great time that Sunday afternoon and a memory I will never forget This awesome little cute speaker charges up quickly just a few hours and good to go and I have used mine for a whole 8 plus shift even if not playing music it would still be on and I have yet to hear any low battery beeps etc. My husband loves that they are waterproof because of him working outside in the dirt and rain. He said what sold him on buying one for him was a friend he worked with had one also and forgot his hanging on the basket on a line truck and the next morning he got it and had dirt and mud on it so he took it over to the water hose and washed it off and all the dirt and mud can completely off and the water didn't do anything to this flip 5 speaker he shook it as dry as he could get it then hung it back on his bucket on his line truck and turned it on and worked just as good as before. I say if u love music and love even sharing music with others this little speaker is highly recommended by me and my husband. It is simple to connect to his and my iPhones. The buttons on the speakers are very easy to press and can be easily seen on the speaker. Also the volume can be adjusted by my iPhone volume buttons too. It makes the cutest sound when connecting to my phone which tells me is is connected. Never had an issue with it disconnecting for no reason. The range is good that is the range that my cell phone is from the speaker never had an issue with that I play music on it and put my cell in my scrub pocket and I am up and down the hallways and in rooms with doors closed and music keeps playing. I can't think of one problem/issue or complaint about this JBL flip 5 speaker. Worth the money and my residents appreciate me spending this small amount of money for them to have some happiness in their day and I do too. My husband bought his from a person advertising a used one wanting to sell when he was up north working I think he bought his for $50 dollars but I always use my Amazon prime so in case I don't like something I buy or have an issue I can return free and free 2 day shipping. And not very much more did I pay here for mine. I got pink and it is a pale pink not bright pink. I like it. I don't know if my managers at the nursing home that I work at would care or not about me playing music over my speaker but even if they did I would probably still sneak and do it because of the reactions I get from my elderly confused residents the smiles on their faces is why I would go against what a manager tells me not to do and do it anyway. These residents don't get much joy to be honest esp since COVID and isolation since middle of March 2020. They are depressed because they can not see (except through a closed window in their rooms) and can not touch their loved ones we that work there and love everyone of our residents don't replace the touch and hugs ans kisses they would be getting from the people they love the most in this world their children and grandchildren and even great grandchildren we have had residents pass away and they and their families haven't seen or touched since COVID and these are precious memories they can never get back it is depressing to me and I play music to keep all our minds off this depressing situation we are in right now and this little speaker helps me do this and is powerful enough to be heard from my med cart all the way down hallways and inside rooms. So even the residents that are bedridden can still hear some good music. So if u like good quality sound that can come from a small well built Bluetooth speaker that won't break your wallet then please buy this one. It also has a rope handle that my husband uses to hang his off the side of his bucket and it be out of his way. He is a lineman and stands in a bucket with limited room up high off the ground sometimes all day long so the rope handle is strong enough to hang this Light weight speaker from a hook and no worries of it breaking. Also I have accidentally dropped my speaker out of my nursing bad onto the cement floor in the nursing home and scared me because I would have been sick if it had broke my awesome speaker but turned it on and worked as usual I dropped it outside in the parking lot and no issues. Hope my review helps you realize this speaker is a good buy and u will be happy u did buy this one.

Sound quality is exactly what's to be expected from JBL and frankly, I was pleasantly surprised with it. Hit the bass boost in a large room and away you go! Now I read with interest the poor reviews primarily centered around battery life or lack thereof. I believe the issue(s) with the battery is consumer induced. I charge the unit before using it (the manual suggest not operating it while plugged in) and directly afterwards before storage. After eight weeks of usage, not so much as a hiccup. Now I imagine running the battery low or until the unit shuts down (also not recommended in the owner's manual) and storing in a discharged state is counter intuitive, unless the the operator has an IQ equal to that of a root vegetable. I highly recommend this product... it performs wonderfully and I imagine, as a JBL product, will so for some time to come. Great value for the dollar.

R3ED0R4VCG7DP7,B0CXKSCY1G,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Speaker for All Needs,Colin,5,"I was in need of a new versatile portable speaker to fit my summer adventures; one that was portable enough to fit in a beach bag and left in my car or to play out in my pool area that packed a punch in sound. After a week of owning this speaker, all in all it has checked every box.TLDR: This speaker, while a tiny bit smaller than what I was expecting, packs amazing sound quality from a trusted brand to easily liven up any outdoor occasion. Their app is great for EQ settings, however the physical ULT button provided great boost to your music by itself to hype up any outdoor event. Waterproofing is great and holds a good charge while being extremely portable with its carrying strap.Packaging:- The speaker arrived in a regular cardboard box. While it was nice to see Sony turn to the newer trend of making packaging as recyclable as possible, I did notice that the pieces holding the speaker were flimsy and could possibly be a concern during delivery. However, mine thankfully arrived in perfect condition. Included inside the box was the speaker itself with the carrying band already attached, a USB A to USB C charging cable, and a very small paper pamphlet. Instructions for the speaker are found through a scanned QR code within this pamphlet which allowed for more information about the speaker to be addressed.Sound Quality:- As to no surprise from this being from Sony, this speaker sounds amazing. It doesn’t get tinny at higher volumes, the dual drivers create amazing bass, and overall it covers all genres with no issue presenting truly enjoyable melodies for all music. At max volume, while the speaker does not get deafening loud if you are outdoors (indoors it possibly will depending on what you define as deafening lol), it certain gets loud enough to entertain a large area. In my 40 foot by 120 foot patio, this speaker shined and was the center piece of great sound quality and entertainment. While it certain suits my needs for loudness, you can always take it a notch up by either using the ULT button or pairing it with a second ULT Field 1 and working them in stereo (both discussed in features).Features:- This speaker is packed with all of the expected features of a modern Bluetooth speaker. It quickly connects to remembered devices when powered on (one nice little note: to power on/off this device, only a single press of the power button is needed for each. While a small detail, it truly is something that is appreciated for ease of use) and has a great battery life. While I cannot speak for the full I’ve gone 6 hours of using the speaker which left it at 50%, so I believe their claim of 12 hours of battery life to be true. This speaker also has a quick charger feature of 10 mins of charging for 3 hours of playback. I haven’t tested that myself as of yet, but I have other newer Song products with similar fast charging features and their claims for those products have not fallen short, so I believe these ones as well.- There is also a Bluetooth pairing button, a multiple use button that can play/pause tracks, skip/reverse tracks, and answer/hang up phone calls depending on need. Functionality was clearly a forethought of this speaker, since this button’s commands—while certainly vast—are greatly designed. Play/pause is a single press, skip is a double press, reverse is a triple press, and it converts to a call answer/hang up button with a single press functionality when you receive a call. There are also independent volume up/down buttons which increase the volume by a decent percentage in each press.- Then there is the ULT button, which is a built in EQ adjustment presented as a physical button on the speaker. It comes with default settings when pressed that noticeably enhance the all around sound quality of any melody, with an emphasis on bass and treble. The EQ for the ULT button can be adjusted in the Sony Music Center app. It’s a great feature to use when you want to give that extra boost to your music.- While I have not tried it myself, this speaker also has the ability to be set in stereo with a second ULT speaker, and I’m sure the dual speaker combination could easily work as a stereo set up for any venue needs.- The waterproofing of this speaker is on par with expectations. I’ve taken it to many water-based areas and have gotten it splashed with water and it’s been completely fine. The USB C charging port is covered with a water tight seal that you can open and close easily.- This speaker works with Sony’s music center app, and while it’s a bit rougher than their headphone app, it still works wonderfully to optimize the speaker’s functionality and performance. Full EQ settings are available, along with specific battery percentage, updates, and settings for the speaker.- The included carrying strap is a nice touch that, I will admit I did not initially think I was going to like, however it very quickly grew on me and I find myself carrying the speaker solely by the strap anywhere I take it. It is tied onto the speaker and can be removed, however you will have to re-tie it yourself if you want to reattach it.Build Quality:- Once again, as expected from this price point and the Song brand, this is truly a high quality speaker. It feels great to hold, with the fabric being sturdy and made of soft material. The buttons are covered in strong rubber that give a satisfying response when pushed. The carrying strap is thick and made of a high quality and very slightly elastic material. You are certainly getting your money’s worth on quality alone, which is what I expect from the Song brand.Final Thoughts:- While it is certainly understandable to hesitant when looking at a $120 Bluetooth speaker, this one truly is worth its value. I have very little complaints with this speaker, and think that it’s a great edition to anyone’s outdoor entertainment experience. The ULT button is a feature I find myself using more than expected (in a good way) to help boost my music during gatherings to help the entertainment. With its waterproofing, I feel comfortable using it as a travel speaker to any destination I plan on visiting. This feature packed speaker is truly one of a kind, and I’m certainly satisfied with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AHWLZPJ4HLRGSDCGXHCEWVVOGX4Q,True,17,Color: Off White

R3MI1MH02YEDHK,B0CXKSCY1G,5.0 out of 5 stars Things I wish I knew before I bought this.,Pat,5,"The media could not be loaded. So, yes 5 stars, and I mean that. To cut to the chase, this is an excellent speaker, and you should get one!Now, I usually do not post reviews, but I thought if you knew all this, it would help you understand why I gave it 5 stars and recommend it so highly!SOUNDIt sounds way bigger than it looks. The ULT button adds a lot of bass and I love that! It is great for EDM, Hip hop, R&B, 80s, 90s,... I tried basically everything I could, and it all sounded great. Even added a little more depth to a classical cello playlist I listen to while I am working.If you like a less bass-heavy sound, just turn the ULT feature off, and it will sound excellent. If that does not suit you, there is a 3-band EQ in the app.OH, and it sounds just as good standing up as it does lying down!!APPAs mentioned, there is an EQ in there!! You can also change other settings and even see the battery life, which I could not believe was still 60% after a couple of days of me casually using it! Super surprised because I never charged it when I got it!Oh, I also noticed the ""group with other speakers,"" and apparently, you can pair another one of these and get stereo sound out of them.... I have not tried that, but I will as soon as I get my second one!STRAPThis was one I was really unsure about when looking at it online. The strap is genius! It can tighten or loosen and then stay in place. My little one liked to carry it around like a purse, but it is really versatile, and I found I could hang it one way or another everywhere I went.DESIGNAgain the design is great, it is very stable standing up or lying down. The buttons are easy to use and because they are raised, you can use them without even looking at them.The SONY logo on the front looks silver most of the time but actually has some... I don't know what, but it changes color, which is a nice touch. See pics.Love the Forest Grey color, it is exactly as expected. A subtle green/grey that I have gotten a lot more comments on than I ever though I would.LIFE/KID-PROOF!Ok, so I like music in the shower, and let me tell you... this thing delivers, even when it got wet it still sounded clear. I did not need to have it at full volume either.Of course, my girls heard it, and when it was bath time, they wanted to have it with them. That is when I discovered it could float!! Now it does not sound great that way, but it still played even after multiple ""accidental"" dunks in the tub! They also loved to see what they could put on the woofer part, and see it dance and fall out.Lastly it is stink proof, as well as mud, sand and waterproof... My daughters and I clean the pond behind our house, usually after big storms, and pick up plastic and other garbage we find. My 6 yo, who likes to hold the speaker as a purse, thought it would be a great idea to bring ""Ultra"" (that is what they named it) with us while we did so. As expected, it dropped into the stinky pond muck when a dragonfly landed on it, and she screamed and tossed it like a live grenade...after fishing it out, I rinsed it off with some dawn and the water hose and it was good as new.To say this has held up remarkably well is an understatement. It looks great, sounds great, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a portable speaker.

R1SSV73W8JIH5E,B0CXKSCY1G,5.0 out of 5 stars Didn't expect the sound quality coming out of this bad boy,Mike Freeman,5,"After trying out Sony Wireless Speaker, I have to say, my family and I were impressed. My teenage son has always been a hard sell on design. He was sold. The shiny Sony logo caught his attention immediately.I was surprise on the sound quality. This is me speaking from comparing to a different Sony speaker I've owned in the past (xb23 is the model number, I think).The ""cool factors"" for me were: 1. push the ULT button to enhance the bass and clear highs that really bring out the music while hanging out in the backyard. 2. Strap - It allows me to hang the speaker on the patio umbrella and out of the way of things (see pic). 3. Setting it up was a breeze. Wifey opened up the box, push the power button, paired the bluetooth, all on her own. Lastly, what really stood out to me was how well-built this speaker is. It feels sturdy and durable, but it's lightweight enough to take with me wherever I go. Plus, the sleek design looks great.Haven't had it long enough to noticed any ""cons"" about this speaker. If I were to say something, I'd say price. I purchased the speaker at regular price because I needed a second unit for our backyard. I'd like to wait for the first sale to purchase 1 or 2 more for my family members with Mother's Day and Graduation around the corner.","Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2024",AFKMNV7MVRWKIXFNFEJOIYWBOUSA,True,13,Color: Off White
R2SOQ8N1C3X1JM,B0CXKSCY1G,5.0 out of 5 stars Did JBL just lose?,Itryditm8,5,"The ULT field 1 is an incredible compact speaker. My Go-to was always the JBL flip series, as i right now own the flip 6.Design: The utility here is great, it has a carry strap that doubles as a hanger, or a handle!, the build is very rugged and high quality, i would not baby this thing at all, it handles its own!Sound & Performance: Out of the box the speaker comes with ULT on, and WOAH!, it gets very loud for its size!. This speaker connects to sony’s music center app, where you can customize the eq, connect in stereo to another field 1, and many other settings!. The sound is very open, clear on vocals ,it fills up a big room really well and maps the sound out. A really great sounding speaker. Battery life is really good,it varies how you use it, but real world use ( 50-80% volume, ULT on) its good for 8-10 hours straight. It does take a while to charge, about 5 hours if its completely drained. But thats good for the overall life of the battery.Compared to JBL flip 6: Ive been back forth between these two for the past couple days. And i found myself reaching for the field 1! It sounds better, its more open, it sounds like the music fills up any room, as for the JBL, it targets the sound directly at you, and the highs are a bit harsh, sony simply just outperforms it!Value: at retail ($128). I would buy this speaker no question. Its great and performs as well as speakers above its weight class.On sale : $98, i would buy it IMMEDIATELY:), insane value.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AGNZEIEKV6LTFUK2YDPG7DPE6SHQ,True,3,Color: Off White
R1CMFWUKND8EM,B0CXKSCY1G,"5.0 out of 5 stars Big sound, little package!!!",Mike,5,"This little speaker surprised me. This “ULT” button packs a punch, but not in the way you would think. Most of my past speakers with a boost button basically increased bass. It’s fine if that’s all you want, but the equalization isn’t there. The bass over-powers the voice or the other instruments. This ULT button gives you more bass - check , and the other sounds also get enhanced. It’s pretty remarkable. The strap is cool. I can hang it from the table umbrella in my back yard. Porting the side speakers was smart. You can use it horizontal like normal or when you stand it vertically, the bottom speaker isn’t fully covered. The air can go somewhere. I think Sony has a winner here. This is definitely coming pool side and beach side on our next trip to FLA. I got the white color. Looks good. I’m glad I picked this one. It’s definitely a keeper.Oh, all the other good stuff. Easy to connect to iPhone. 12 hour battery is very good for me and small for its power. Also works as a speaker phone and all the proofs.

R1P2OVKCR03MLZ,B0CXKSCY1G,5.0 out of 5 stars New Sony drop is perfect for budget audiophiles,BB,5,"If you're on the fence, get this! I was looking for a new speaker to replace my old UE Boom that had a static tick in it (love UE, but every speaker I've had goes this route eventually).This new portable Sony speaker didn't have the thousands of reviews that more expensive (or cheaper and well-known but risker) speakers had. However, every review was positive and they were right (so far). Though I've only had this about a month, it's been a massive improvement in my home and away music setup. The sound is gorgeous. The bass is clear and deep. I'm sure audiophiles can find a $1000 speaker that will be tuned to perfection, but for music fans without those funds (and who need a trusty travel speaker) this is the one.The forest green/grey looks cool and shows off how well-made it is.Only potential con so far is that it takes a while to shut off by itself. I don't have the Sony app so maybe this is a setting you can change. It's by no means a problem, unless you are banking on it shutting itself off. The connection lasts even if your music app closes which is nice.The rope handle also makes it so you can't just slam it down; it has to be the right orientation. It's tied loosely though, so you could untie it for more position flexibility, you'd just have a longer string to carry it.I am very particular and this speaker checked all my boxes! 10/10 recommend.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AFBXJGYWY3QZXF2IZTRJYOW3UO7A,True,0,Color: Forest Gray
RJFBE7W2A9HWL,B0CXKSCY1G,5.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly Great!,Fabian,5,"What I was looking for was a compact bluetooth speaker that packs a punch in bass, so I decided to give this Sony speaker a try and boy was I surprised by it! 1. Bluetooth pairing - First, pairing this was super easy. I happen to have an Android phone and once bluetooth is on, it automatically pops up on my phone and asks if I want to pair it.2. Design - for a compact size speaker, it is really lightweight and because the speaker is shaped the way it is, it can easily stand up by itself or laid out sideways. The tether that comes with it can easily be strapped on to my backpack or a bicycle.3. Bass - The sound varies depending on the position of the speaker, but the bass is surprisingly good! The secret here is the ""ult"" button. Once you press that, it really amps up the bass while not sacrificing the clarity of the vocals. What I thought was cool was the companion app that you can use to control the speaker in which you can also customize the sound through the equalizer. I am not too picky when it comes to sound, but the opportunity to customize it will be super flexible for those who like their own sound.4. Sound Quality and Distance - This to me was the main reason why I am giving it 5 stars. The sound quality has really good range from the low tones to the high tones. I like to listen to the variety of different styles of music and I am very impressed of the sound reproduction of this speaker. Usually, I am not too far away from the speaker, but there had been times where I had to go downstairs to do something and what's nice is that the speaker had really good range for a bluetooth speaker. The sound never cut out once. As a bonus, what I discovered in the app, was an option to either turn on sound quality performance or focus on a stable connection and I think that will allow some people to really enjoy their music even from a far away distance.5. Price - $128 is still a lot of money, but for this amount of money and what I am getting from this speaker. I say it is well worth it because I can take this literally anywhere outside or inside. There have been a couple of times when my phone was paired to the speaker and somebody called in and I had a conversation with them not knowing I can actually talk to them from the speaker! So yes, if you can afford this speaker, I say give this a try! You won't be disappointed!","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AGCP3WP3ZNQM7W7TXE7ADU62LOXQ,True,15,Color: Black

I have been looking for a replacement for some time but found most options lacking, especially in matching the Bose’s bass. However, from the first listen, these blew me away. They sound clean, can get very loud, amazing battery life but most of all they have unbelievably great bass from such a small package! It’s a bit bigger than the Bose but is actually lighter and overall build quality is excellent, with some nice details. The ULT mode is awesome and the connection is strong, even through walls or far away when outside. I love the orange but I am mindful that it is a cloth cover with semi-exposed tweeters on the ends, so I’d recommend a case or something if taking it to dirty environments or in a bag mixed with sharp things. The rubber on both sides does leave me comfortable that if this falls it won’t be any issue, plus it works well for placing vertically in tight spaces. Overall, can highly recommend and would say it’s no comparison to the UE boom, Bose sound link flex or Beats Pill I had previously tried.","Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2024",AETUKYROFNVEVSRJY2ABCK6XYUSA,True,4,Color: Orange

I honestly thing this is better compared to the JBL charge not the JBL flip, I think Sony just dropped JBL . The part that sucks is that you gotta get another Field 1 for stereo while JBL can partner up with any other JBL.You can use the custom EQ to get the Sound louder and clearer or atleast to you liking.

R294Q4QN96UURC,B0CXKSCY1G,5.0 out of 5 stars Magnificent Comeback by Sony with the ULT Field 1,Lu,5,"Wow, Sony! What a magnificent comeback. This is the best-sounding speaker I've encountered at this size and price. The hourglass shape is great for palming it. Initially, I didn't think I'd like the strap, but I love how tight it is—making it a perfect handle. The speaker can seamlessly stand or sit facing you or directly up to disperse the sound evenly. Doing a Hz test next to one of my Charge 5’s, it easily competes. I did these tests on my mattress to better feel the vibration of each unit. The Sony produced noticeably more vibration than the Charge 5, which blew my mind. Supposedly designed to compete with the Flip 6, it's, in my opinion, better than my Charge 5. Whatever Sony’s engineers are doing, they hit a home run. The clarity is wild, the bass response is wild, and the ULT button sounds like it’s unleashing the Iron Giant, and I’m here for that. Most speakers don't appear on my “connected devices” widget, but this one does. After listening for the last 4 hours at about 50% volume with ULT turned on, I only lost 20% of the battery. Bluetooth connection is swift, taking about 3 seconds from pressing the power button to streaming audio from your connected device. I purchased the orange ULT Field 1. Normally, I go for neutral colors like white, gray, or black, but this orange really pops and looks sweet. It comes with a short 12” Sony-branded USB-A to USB-C charging cable. Sony, you should hook us up with 3-foot cables. Sony has truly outdone themselves with the ULT Field 1. The combination of design, performance, and features makes it a standout speaker in its category.

R2LXPDPJ7ZTXGE,B0CXKSCY1G,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Poolside Speaker,E.J,5,"First off, I have 4 college age children so over the years we have gone through our share of portable speakers. So when Sony announced their new lineup and after reading a couple of early reviews I decided to take a chance on the new ULT1. As for the looks this ""Gator"" orange color is great. It stands out and it's exactly what I was looking for and when turning it on the first time it immediately notified my phone which made pairing simple. The design is perfect with the ""handle"" in the right spot and when I did my ""can it float test"" it righted itself every time and didn't loose a beat! As for that handle, at first it comes off a bit odd but once you realize it's dual purpose it's fairly cool. In terms of size it's about as good as it gets, as it's small enough to fit in a cup holder but big enough to feel substantial. Now for what counts. The sound quality is fantastic! As many other speakers in the same class I was expecting moderate performance but the sound was crisp, but not tin canish and the bass was great for a speaker this size. Out of the box it has the ULT boost on but you can shut it off with a touch of a button. From a durability standpoint the edges seem stout and could probably handle the inevitable drops to come! Finally as for the battery it lasted all afternoon on Mother's Day in the unforgiving Florida heat and humidity so I'd say it will do it's job on a beach day as well. All in all I'm very happy with the ULT1 and I'm looking forward to the enjoyment it will bring my family!","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2024",AE4ZT3YRO52IIPX2LKOJLEM3STMQ,True,2,Color: Orange

I was looking for days for a new speaker because my other one got jacked I had the Bose sound link mini which also is a great speaker but compared to the new model or this Sony xlt model I was torn. 1 I know how Bose is so I was like damn but I was looking into Sony and only because I was thinking of getting a tv and ppl who had Sony talked highly. There are so many Sony speakers and different price points. This speaker sounded like you had a subwoofer and connected speakers at a party that’s how the quality was in this mini speaker. It’s water proof the strap was better than expected I didn’t care for it but now I can attach to my surroundings environment it’s like an extra nice touch. The app you download is not needed to play or connect it’s just nice if u have multiple speakers to connect gives you battery info etc. the charging is usb C and it fast charging. I just got this speaker and I’m writing a review this shows how excited and amazed I am still ha. The Price for the speaker well it’s definitely worth it. 1 u can buy two for under 300 vers 1 speaker for that price and have surround sound. The to speakers that come in this one price is worth it buy it if you are thinking about it. No jack cable I don’t have anything that needs it so I’m good haha. You can also play it sideways and it has some holes so it can work with out disrupting sound quality,"Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2024",AEEMRSATKMRUUULMPKY5YTLBZY5Q,True,4,Color: Orange

R3SWOS1Q15L0AD,B0CXKSCY1G,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound! Blows JBL and Bose away!,Johnny Utah,5,Went in to a local store and compared to JBL and Bose and Sony blew them away. Sony ULT 1 is awesome and I'll explain why.Bass is still extremely strong but does not drown out the highs and for the first time I hear a mid range. The sound is just so much better compared to JBL. JBL has always sounded hollow to me like I was missing half the sound. Now I realize it's just a small speaker but Sony made me realize I have been missing something. If you want great sound quality Sony does it best. The design is killer I currently have it on my island in the kitchen and it's super easy to connect with my iPhone. Most of all no light show pretty straight forward which I like when I go camping and the beach. I'm definitely going to get the bigger version ULT7 for the pool but wanted to test this one first.

I needed a speaker which could get a little wet. This little Sony speaker is just right. It's small, but has big sound. If it gets a little splashed, no problem. Perhaps I should point out that I can't wear hearing aids in the shower. So, this solved my problem. But, more than that, it's just a good sounding speaker and is well made.

Not quite what is advertised. Plus the sound really wasn’t that great, as others claimed. And it did not get loud enough for my preference. It’s an OK speaker, but not for the $128 price range. At best, maybe $79.99 would be more appropriate.

It looks very nice sitting in an office, or even just on a shelf. The small design, is very well made. You can tell the difference right away when you first pick up this speaker, that it is not cheaply made (not that I would expect nothing less form Sony, or any other vendor of this caliber), and the design aspects are on point; to be beautiful and functional at the same time, with much attention to detail of the design.The thing that I wasn't impressed with is the sound. I think this speaker works well at low volumes. If you intend to listen to your music alone or in an office setting, then this may work for you, but don't engage in any high expectations from this speaker.As I mentioned earlier, if you set it on a low volume the sound is really not that bad. I would recommend turning on the ULT button, and never turning it off again for the life of the speaker. This gives it a much fuller sound at low volumes, and if you close your eyes and listen, then you just might hear a hint of bass coming through.If your mischievous, and you do decide to turn the volume up more than half way, then you wil begin to NOT enjoy the tinny sound coming from the speaker, as the clarity immediately fades away.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AFEGGRZ2KH5OZPE5ESYHC2Y4USTA,False,3,Color: Off White
R1WVFAKBKYJEAQ,B0CXKSCY1G,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent affordable BT speaker - could be better.,REMY REVIEWS,4,"Just to summarize my thoughts on the ULT Field 1 quickly..Some pros:- Good quality audio- Dustproof, waterproof, etc.- SpeakerphoneSome cons:- Lacks good bass, despite it's ""ULT"" button. It's not terrible but it really seems to be hit and miss. I don't get why it varies but it's not what I expected.- Battery lifeFabric lined with silicone ends, it's fairly standard looking for a bluetooth speaker. A strap runs across the entire back which is useful for holding onto or hanging the speaker. Utilizes bluetooth, obviously, its is compatible with BT 5.3 and it supports Google Fast Pair. I didn't realize at first but you can link two units in the app for stereo playback.The control panel is a simple and intuitive layout. Power, Bluetooth pairing, play, volume up/down and ULT. The play button will also answer or end calls and it will navigate tracks.You get a cover on the back which protects the USB-C port. Charging with USB-C is great to see, by the way, and they include a USB-A to USB-C charging cable with the speaker.The speaker itself is IP67 rated which means completely dustproof and can be submerged at a depth of up to one meter for up to 30 minutes.I don't plan on using this as a speakerphone but it works well enough but you need to stay fairly close to the speaker as the signal doesn't seem particularly strong.Battery life just seems lackluster, just like the ""ULT"" bass. Sony says approximately 12 hours at volume 25 (50%) with the ULT function turned on. If you play at 100% volume, with ULT on, that drops to 3 hours. You can use the STAMINA function in the app for reduce power consumption. Speaking of battery life, and the app, when pair with your phone, you are able to see the speakers remaining battery life on your phone.Overall, it's fine. It's nothing special and even at the affordable price, I think there are better options out there from some of the big name competitors. I wasn't sure whether or not to give it 3 or 4 stars. I'd give it 3.5, if that were an option but it's not so I rounded up.","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2024",AGPFBQD6BRRKEVEI3IAKXAEV4WWA,False,2,Color: Black
R73UKTQOWQ00E,B0CXKSCY1G,"5.0 out of 5 stars Nice little speaker, great sound!",E.Swope,5,"I could say that this little speaker is surprisingly loud... but Sony is not all about loud, it is more about uality. That it has a solid build quality is more or less a given, reliability and connectivity too. The Sony Ult field 1 speaker hearkens back to their XB series. That is, it has the familiar form... and if you have seen it a lot, that is the speaker the others were imitating. Like all of Sony's portable speakers (that I am aware of) it is rated ip67 for water and dust resistance. It is pretty rugged, but don't throw it in a pool. It is not 100% waterproof. Sony doesn't play a lot of tricks to distract you from mediocre sound, because it isn't. Like few other companies which make portable blue tooth speakers, Sony does provide some audio spec... because ther3 is nothing to hide. Unlike most other portable blue tooth speakers, this small speaker has full range sound: 20 hz to 20 khz. They don't brag about their tuning. because they do not have to tweak it to cover the missing detail. All that said, the sound is rich and details. While you do not see a prominent bass boost, it is, essentially, built in (and the ult button does provide that boost, should you want it). The Field one is pretty pared down, no flashing or pulsating lights, just great sound. It may not be the loudest put there, but it is absolutely loud enough. I listened to it outdoors yesterday, and despite its' size it holds up well to open air listening. It is also very easy to use, with dedicated buttons for each function. The one surprise to me is that there are no high res blue tooth codecs, and no aux in, but then if you are using aux in it is somewhat less portable... This one is, very portable, easy to carry, easy to use, easy to listen to. I haven't found anything which does not sound good on this speaker, but that is what you get with a full range speaker. I buy a lot of Sony equipment because it is reliable in so many ways, build quality, sound quality, stable connections and up to date protocols. At the end of the day, yes this little speaker sounds louder than you would expect from its' size, but also richer, fuller and with great clarity and detail.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AGASAFHLQKQP7RNG76TKN4GPBJBQ,False,0,Color: Orange
R29M7D39J532PZ,B0CXKSCY1G,4.0 out of 5 stars Not necessarily an improvement from their past offerings,tkm,4,"I've always been a huge fan of Sony bluetooth speakers because they offered great quality, build and sound. While the Sony quality is still there, I'm not sure the sound is up-to-par with their past offerings.There's a lot of competitors in this space and what set Sony apart from them was that they really focused on making a great sounding speaker including a ""live sound"" mode, extra bass, all with having stereo drivers. Unfortunately, the stereo drivers have been abandoned so that means no more spatial live sound mode (which sounded great, BTW). The extra bass is still there, but that's there in most all of the models around this price range.Bose and JBL both mostly abandoned stereo drivers a while back but Sony still held out and I rewarded them with my purchases. Now, I don't really see much difference between a Sony, JBL and many of the other players on the market (Tribit, etc). Granted, a bluetooth speaker is typically not a critical listening device, but the Sony's of the past were borderline audiophile in their implementation. They, by far, had the best stereo implementation out of a single box bluetooth speaker. Whatever DSP magic they built into them was fantastic. That magic is, unfortunately, gone for this speaker line.The bass on the Sony is still really good though...I played a 50hz test-tone and was able to hear the tone clearly. Many so-called ""extra bass"" speakers can't even come close to playing a note that low, so the Sony still does a fantastic job in that area.The build is still good; typical of what you'd expect a Sony to be. This speaker does lack a 3.5mm input jack though (which I'm not sure why as it could have easily been put next to the USB-C port that's under a rubber cover). Bluetooth connectivity was easy. Fortunately, no ridiculous LED lights on this model so I am thankful for that. In the past Sony did give the option to turn them off or make them a solid color vs. always having them flash to the beat of the music like other brands forced upon you.I did not try TWS as I do not have two of the units. However, this would likely be the best way to listen to them as I'd love to hear a stereo image from a pair of these. My curiosity might get the best of me and if so I will update this review at that time.I'm not sure why Sony abandoned their last few generations of bluetooth speakers so quickly. Seems like just last year or so the best bluetooth speaker they've ever made IMO (the SRS-XBx3, specifically the XB43) was being cleared out for the new XG series. Now we're getting the ULT series after a short amount of time. I don't want to say that this new series sounds poor, as it certainly does not. But, it's just another mono speaker now and seems to be made for the poolside/beach party rather than listening more critically in a kitchen or bedroom. Granted, it does have a lot of low and quality bass so that mojo has not went away, but the live sound modes and dual L/R drivers disappearing is a disappointment.So as a long time Sony bluetooth speaker fan I am a bit disappointed in the direction that they've taken with the ULT lineup. They still make some of the best bluetooth speakers available, but their focus now seems to be headed in a different direction. If that direction is a pool party or other outdoor party-type of environment, this speaker will serve you very well and is certainly the quality and clear sound that you'd expect from the Sony name. If you have one of their older stereo speakers and enjoy it, hold onto that as this version will likely only be a suitable replacement if you buy two of them for TWS mode.","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2024",AGOT7D3GZFVAZMP5VJUXVODL3U2A,False,12,Color: Black

This Sony speaker has great sound and isn't too big or bulky.It has a nice rope-like handle for carrying.It connects easily via bluetooth and feels durable. The quality of the speaker seems excellent.It has a ton of extra features which I have not tested. Honestly, I don't often pair multiple speakers or use my speakers for phone calls, but it's nice to know this speaker has those features if you need them.For me, bluetooth speakers need to have good sound and be mobile, as I often take them on the go. This speaker delivers on both fronts. You can certainly pay less for a no-name speaker that gives ok sound and features.

Victor,5,"Only the Tribit Stormbox Flow has louder deep bass than the Sony Ult 1 in this size category. But the Flow also only has one driver, and it just doesn't sound as detailed even if you adjust the EQ using the Tribit app for more clarity. I would rather have the Sony Ult 1 as my go to small speaker for overall performance.That said, for $128 (at time of review) there are other speakers that I would direct your attention as better alternatives if you don't mind the size being bigger.The Lonzuer Action is the speaker on the left in the picture. It's not much heavier, and at time of this review it is $108.99 and gets louder with much fuller bass than the Sony Ult 1. It features a back firing speaker at the rear that when put close to a wall (but not against the wall) really helps fill up a room. It's retro look is sleek, it has bass, volume, and treble knobs on top for quick adjustment. It has louder bass than a JBL Xtreme 2.The MLove A200 is a gem. It's the off-white and gold speaker in the pic. This thing has MEGA bass. I was shocked at how good it sounds relative to it's price. It has volume, bass, and treble knobs. It gets loud but with controlled bass. It really is at the price of $90 (at time of review) a steal in terms of sound per dollar. It's my go to when I don't want to lug a bigger partybox or the Stormbox Blast around.Lastly, the DOLPHIN LX90 at $120 (at time of this review) is a real party speaker. It has tight punchy deep bass - and it should, it's a huge speaker. It's mids and highs are kind of a mess, it's not meant for critical listening. It's just big dumb fun. The A200 and the LX-90 are pretty neck and neck in terms of overall bass. But the LX90 gets loud, making it a great budget boombox.There you have it, this is a great speaker for it's size. It has a 3 band EQ in the Music Center app (instead of a 5 band for the ULT-7) But I laid out some alternatives in the price range that should be considered. They are all louder with more bass than this ULT1.

R14TDMYNDRULVM,B0CXKSCY1G,5.0 out of 5 stars Sony ULT Field 1 Bluetooth Speaker,M. Hill,5,"Featuring enhanced bass this Bluetooth speaker is compact and has noticeable weight for its size which gives it a quality feel. It arrives with a one foot long USB A to USB C charging cable and while it may be operated manually as a standard Bluetooth speaker it may also be controlled by the Sony Music Center app which to fully utilize all the features requires at least a second speaker. A small reference guide is included but a UPC code is provided on the underside of the box lid for an online version of a more detailed manual.For a Bluetooth speaker where portability is the point the sound is surprising good--clear and precise although at higher volumes reproduction is somewhat tinny. The bass boost adds depth which seems all the more necessary in an outdoor setting where acoustics are non-existent. Overall at this price point the speaker has an excellent sound and a solid build. If interested operation details follow.On arrival I plugged it into a USB A charging port during which a small orange LED light located below the power button was illuminated and when fully charged the light went out. After gently pressing the power button a small green light and a small blue light are illuminated. If familiar with Bluetooth pairing the operation is straightforward and if not information is available in the manual. Ready to listen to music I manually connected the speaker to my iPhone music library.The touch control panel at the top of the speaker includes a power, Bluetooth, play/pause, volume minus & plus along with the ULT bass boost control. A water resistant trap door at the back of speaker covers a USB C port for charging. There is a built-in omnidirectional microphone to use during phone calls. The location is not obvious but it is approximately an inch to the right of the control panel and an inch below.Battery life is stated to be 12 hours at level 25 volume which is approximately 50 percent and at full volume 3 hours. The ends on the speaker have a rubberized bumper which should offer some shock protection if dropped. The IP67 rating means it is dustproof and water resistant in up to 3 feet of water for a maximum of 30 minutes.

I have several Sony speakers from the past years and this one is definitely up there with my favorites. My other favorite has lights that go to the music, this one does not include that but instead is a lot more portable which I love. Main reason for loving this speaker and Sony in general is the bass!A lot of other speakers around this price range, that are actually portable, just don’t sound good enough to me bc I don’t get enough bass. This one has a button labeled ULT which I believe means Ultimate. Well that button brings in bass or takes it away, and wow what a difference it makes turning it on! It isn’t bass that has too much vibration either, it really does completely compliment all sounds of the music playing. I also utterly love that it was sooo easy to pair to my phone! Literally turn on Bluetooth on both, and find the right speaker and pair!It does have an app you can use for all kinds of equalizer options which is great for customizing how you listen to music and being able to change things around depending on your taste! I am super content with the default settings but it’s nice to know that is an option for classical music or other unique sounds! I have not tested the waterproof level or ruggedness, and I love this speaker so much I don’t really want to get it dirty or wet!

Which is loud and powerful, while delivering a warm solid bass. I wanted something smaller that I can leave in the car.This unit is about 8"" inches long and a bit bigger than 3 "" inch in diameter. The speaker came fully charged and was wrapped nicely in a white cloth bag. The only accessory that comes with is a USB Type-C cable.Upon turning on the speaker, my phone immediately recognized the speaker with an icon of the speaker. Asked me if I wanted to pair the speaker and about 1 minute later. My phone with paired with the speaker.Having own other brands and off brands. I think Sony is really stepping up their game with the portable sound system. I played a few classical music like from Mozart and Beethoven. The mids and high are nice and crisp. The bass is tight and doesn't sound muddy. At 50% this speaker really rhunpa and sounds great. There was no hint of any distortion once I turned the volume up to 80%.Also tested this speaker with some 80' old school rap/hip hop. Man, does this little speaker really put out the bass and ""juice"". It got so loud, my wife has walked into the living room and asked me to turn it down.Overall this is a rich sounding and powerful bass speaker system. It definitely will live in the vehicle when we're out relaxing somewhere outdoor. The only gripe is not sure what to do with the Paracord type it's loop from end of the speaker to the next. So I might just remove it.Also it has a IP 67 rating so it will be perfect for the outdoors when I go camping. So anyone who's looking to get a small powerful rich sounding speaker.

It turns out that it is; a really good portable speaker.One thing I liked was having a color choice. I'm getting weary of having all black devices, so being able to get an off white speaker (the same as my headphones) was a pleasure. You can also get gray or orange (orange? really?) instead of black or off white, but they didn't have the vibe I wanted. Nice to have the choice, though.Now, on to the speaker's sound. It's pretty remarkable. I wanted to give it a true test, so I first put it on the other side of the room, about twenty feet away, and let it do its thing using the ULT feature. I thought it might sound boomy, but it actually had a nicely balanced sound across a range of music genres. The sould filled the area nicely and, apart from its not having a stereo soundstage, sounded like a quality set of home speakers. I was surprised and very pleased. In shorter distances, I turned off the ULT feature and it still sounded great, without excess bass response at all.The speaker itself is a good size, too; not too large, like some of the behemoths you see these days. Still portable, and described as waterproof and dustproof, too. Very cool. Its charge time and duration are very reasonable, actually better than most bluetooth speakers I've had of about that size.So, you can see that I have nothing negative to say about this Sony product.

Its waterproof and dustproof design means I can take it virtually anywhere, from poolside parties to beach outings, without worrying about damage. Plus, the fact that it's floatable adds an extra layer of convenience for outdoor adventures.The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and reliable, with a range of up to 131 feet, allowing me to stream music from my device with ease. I love that I can control playback and volume directly from the speaker, making it simple to adjust settings on the fly.Overall, the Ultimate Ears WONDERBOOM 3 is the perfect travel companion for music lovers.

R1JY4S66T5RW83,B09KX6RT7Q,"5.0 out of 5 stars Ticks all my boxes, here's how to pair!",Erica T.,5,"The media could not be loaded. So I bought two of these speakers on a whim during Black Friday having never bought a wonderboom product before, and I can say now that it was 100% worth it. I really like the big volume buttons so it's not a tiny surface when you're pressing down, I also really like that they are water resistant so I don't have to worry about changing the volume while washing dishes or hanging it out of the spray when showering. I've also spilled the glass of water on the same surface and there has been no problems. The hoop is stretchy but I like to have a carabiner on it to make attaching it to other things simple and to have a primary speaker I easily identifiable. Having a primary speaker is important for pairing, your primary will be the speaker that has a connection through your phone, so if you only want to grab one speaker having the primary easily identifiable is nice so you don't have to go through repairing things, which isn't necessarily hard but it's much simpler this way.The sound quality isn't astounding but it's good and despite being small it can get pretty loud, I've yet to use them at full volume. I'm really happy with how long the charge lasts, I don't find myself recharging them very often though I use them daily, and when I do it only takes a few hours. Ultimately very happy with these speakers!","Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2024",AEJPPR5H7GRCHR4VDOF4WCBDO7NA,True,14,Color: Hyper PinkStyle: Wonderboom 3

So I pulled the trigger on 2 nice black WONDERBOOM 3's that were for some reason selling new for only $59 and the black looks real nice in my BR with a white Dresser and white deco They sound so nice - u really dont need to pair two of them. Also i think Each will loose some volume if u do pair them anyway which is why I like the all-around sound. Both the 2's and 3's are similar. I cant tell a diff.

I recently switched to Samsung Galaxy S24, and now it has a glitch that fades out audio intermittently. Similar to how cuss words are omitted in some videos online, the audio cuts out for a fraction of a second, but just long enough to miss the word being spoken/sung at that moment. I don't think I can return this but if I had known this would happen, I wouldn't have gotten it. I have a UE Boom 2 from 2017 that was dropped off the fourth floor balcony of an apartment complex that still works perfectly and I reverted to using that, even though the size and shape are less convenient for my needs.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2024",AFUZNRVK6OOJ4KCG5QXV7XD3WZ3A,True,0,Color: Active BlackStyle: Wonderboom 3

R3LTC79BP84IIG,B09KX6RT7Q,4.0 out of 5 stars Which if the three is worth?,Timothy James,4,"Wonderboom 3 is definitely a sharper enhancement from the WB2. The difference between WB2 and WB1 is quite smaller unless you do get two WB2s to pair them. I though it wasn’t possible, but I make instrumentals and WB3 has a more punchy bass with richer/clearer mids and highs. If WB2 was a 9, WB3 is def a 10. The outdoor mode does louden them, but only so much(it is perfect for keeping the music). The distance when they are paired before they start to distort can be fairly large but not large distances.When it comes to ordering two of them for pairing, if you want full surround sound speakers, these are not meant for you. Imagine high end tv speakers but you can place them wherever you want while being able to carry them in your hands with ease, that’s what WB3&2 are. However, if you want speakers that live up to their name, look no further. The prices are haunting, but you won’t be disappointed. If you have WB2s, I would suggest waiting a while for the WB3 prices drop as they are already a wonderful pair. On the other hand, if you have the money to spend, go ahead and but 2 of them for the stereo as you eventually will, and you will be amazed and won’t be able to listen to single speakers ever again.Downsides > fairly long time to charge, recommend charging over night.WB3 are a bit better at this but > will die within 3-6 hours if you are playing loud music that uses a lot of bass or has a lot of things happening. (Playing at max volume but like a movie or podcast doesn’t cause this)There is a little catch of the speaker gets hot > it will drain the battery faster and will get to low battery(the white light will turn red) quicker. If the speakers are too hot, they will shut off, and I mean hot to the touch. Just let them cool off completely and the Battery will return back to normal. However, sometimes you can power them back on right after, when they are completely dead, the red light will flash, so at that point you have to charge them.Again, they are expensive, you won’t be disappointed, but at the same time you’ll be heavily missing out if you don’t have two of them(WB3 or WB2) for the stereo sound.I hope this review helps, please ask any questions you may have.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2022",AG7UCVX3UWZDD7TICTJNQU4ZVROQ,True,49,Color: Joyous Brights GreyStyle: Wonderboom 3

R1SA1B3ZJRTOPU,B09KX6RT7Q,"4.0 out of 5 stars Difficult to pair 2, but good once you know the trick",William Gilmyers,4,"Purchased two of these to use in my backyard. I liked that they were small, so I could move them around easily, but that they provide outsize sound given the small form factor. Key feature for me was the ability to to pair them together.The latter part was more difficult than I anticipated. I would connect one speaker, turn on the other, which would then 'steal' the music from the first. Pushed the button on the top of both speakers at the same time, as the instructions imply. This does not work, and actually disconnects both speakers from the input device (I'm using an iPhone to play Spotify, for what it's worth) and pauses the music. No way to reconnect without turning the speakers off and then on again, which gets you back to square one. I called tech support and even they couldn't figure it out, though they did share a video which gave me the 'clue' I needed to make it work. Here's the secret:1. Once you've paired both speakers, turn them on; one will connect to the source, one won't, as noted above.2. Then push the middle button on the top on the speaker that is NOT playing music, until it makes the beep-boop-beep sounds.3. Release that button, THEN press the speaker on the other speaker until it beeps and boops.4. Music will pause, but after a few more seconds of beeps and boops you'll be reconnected and can restart the music and both speakers will play nice together.Having figured this out I'm quite happy with the purchase- 5 stars if it wasn't such a hassle and the instructions weren't so inadequate. Lots of references to the app, which isn't even compatible with the Wonderboom 3. In general the instructions and support materials leave a lot to be desired. But it's a nice product once you figure out the 'trick' and get it working.","Reviewed in the United States April 10, 2023",AGEGHJ6EAWWOL4HVFWWG7STP744Q,True,103,Color: Active BlackStyle: Wonderboom 3

This product came highly recommended by the team at NYT Wirecutter. And they were right; this little speaker is small, lightweight, has great sound, and great battery life. However the most weird choice they made was using a micro USB to USB-A cord. So if you're traveling and you forget this specialized charging cord hopefully you don't plan on using it for the full 14 hour advertised battery life (or the 20 hour real battery life). Because using your USB-C charging cable that you have with every other piece of modern technology won't work. While I gave this a 5 star based on the requested metrics, in reality this big oversight in charging compatibility cables takes it down to a 4 star for me.","Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2024",AGBNBVMLZWBLQG77WG4F2ZNVJL2A,True,16,Color: Active BlackStyle: Wonderboom 3
RCGV5NMTHKPPC,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Value Soundbar,Lance Hough,5,"I've now had this sound bar for just under four years. It is still performing wonderfully, still sounds great, and still works just as well as the day I took it out of the box. The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price you pay. Is it perfect? No? Will it hold up to a unit that's 4x the price? Not even kinda. But is it better than the speakers on your standard consumer-grade flat-screen TV? You better believe it. Better by a mile. It has several different sound modes depending on what you're watching, easily connects to your Bluetooth devices to play music, and offers very simple connection to your TV. The remote is crap, but you likely won't need it anyway. Most TVs now come with programmable remotes that you can use to control the basic functions of the soundbar. I use the Yamaha Soundbar app to control the more detailed features as it's easier and more clear visually. It gets plenty loud and does not distort or crack in higher volumes. I have noticed that when watching OTA broadcast TV (read: not through a cable box or streaming device), TV shows that feature live music performances are particularly challenging for this soundbar. The vocals during songs are always totally buried. However, watching music videos, streaming music, or watching concert videos seems to be fine. It's a strange issue, but there's no doubt it exists. And I've tried multiple modes with no success. But it's a minor issue comparatively. I'm very happy with this unit and will continue to use it until one of us stops working.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2024",AG2LX62LCZ3EQYIZNIAV2D3O7H2A,True,1,Style: YAS-109BL

R50V9T04DPPMV,B07T5GGR8L,4.0 out of 5 stars Tough to beat for the price!,Joe,4,"I am working on transforming part of my basement into a semi-finished space for a small exercise room. Sound off of a TV's built in speakers isn't going to cut it, so I needed a better solution.I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile, but I do appreciate good sound. I have a bunch of conventional receiver/speaker setups throughout the house - several 2.0 systems and a 5.1 in the living room.In this basement application, I wanted something simpler and cheaper. I compared this Yamaha setup to a similar Polk and Klipsch sound bar/sub combination. I have had positive experiences with all three brands, but ended up choosing the Yamaha mainly due to the killer price.The subwoofer was a little bigger than I expected for a 6.5"" unit, but not big enough to be an issue in my intended location. One oddity with the bar itself - the mounting holes aren't 16"" on center even though they easily could have been. I mounted it to a cedar plank wall and fortunately I still had the back side open and was able to add a couple 2x4s between studs to provide a more solid mounting point. On sheetrock, I think you'd be okay with good sized anchors since it isn't terribly heavy but it would still be better if Yamaha had gone with a standard 16"" spacing to allow for hitting studs.The unit powered up right away and was relatively easy to add to my wireless network. It is 2.4 GHz only, like many smart home devices but this is okay for me. 2.4 GHz could have interference issues in a dense apartment building, however. The app is okay - it seems they should have fit more controls on one page, but I don't anticipate using it much.I immediately queued up some songs on Spotify to try it out. It played over the network without an issue. Rating the sound quality depends on what you're comparing it to. If I compare it to the RCF Monitors in my garage or my Yamaha driven Polk 5.1 setup in the living room it's not even close, but I wasn't expecting it to be given the huge difference in price. Compare it to a solid set of 2.1 computer speakers at a similar price point, though, and it'll absolutely blow them away. I unfortunately can't compare to other sound bars since I have limited experience with them.For this application, it's plenty. Music does sound good - the bass is solid for a 6.5"" subwoofer, and the mids/highs are better than expected for such a compact unit. I've been using it while I continue remodeling the basement and I'm happy with the sound quality. I leave it set on stereo as other modes seem somewhat artificial to me.I did run into an issue with Bluetooth - I could not get it to appear as an option no matter how hard I tried. I performed a factory reset and that fixed the issue. Otherwise, it's been working very reliably.Bottom line: If you're looking for a secondary system in a basement or bedroom, this should suit your needs very well. For a small to medium sized living room, it would be acceptable and a whole lot better than TV speakers if you aren't willing to invest in a 5.1 or 7.1 system. For the price, it's tough to go wrong.","Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2023",AHVSNGUVQK35ZGUQB5IBMC4H6XDQ,True,28,Style: ATS-2090BL-R
R3KSST9OWGJLEJ,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Built-in speakers on today's TV are horrible. This Yamaha soundbar is so much better.,Tyson B.,5,"I received this ATS-2090 soundbar from Yamaha in renewed condition. It arrived professionally repackaged, in custom formed protective styrofoam and each major component in a sealed plastic bag. The only piece which showed any evidence of prior use was one of the two power cords. The twist tie used to secure it was slightly distorted. No parts or documentation were missing.The firmware on the unit was out of date, but the sound bar automatically updated itself as soon as it was connected to my home WiFi network. I might comment that it (the soundbar) only supports 2.4GHz wireless networks. There is no 5GHz WiFi support. I had no problems installing the app on my iPhone, and I find the app easy to navigate and extremely useful.The sound quality is so much better than the built-in speakers on my bargain 40"" flat panel TV. I knew the built-in speakers were bad, but after enjoying this sound bar it would be impossible to go back. I did adjust the bass level to +0 (it is set to +3 as a default) and I turned off the ""bass extension"" option using the app. With these adjustments, the bass from the wireless subwoofer integrates reasonably well and really accentuates most any TV program or movie soundtrack. I do have the wireless subwoofer located a few inches away from the wall, near a corner of the room, and just behind the TV itself.The actual connectivity took a little bit of experimentation. This is not a problem with the soundbar itself, but rather a consequence of the technology. My TV does not have an ARC capable HDMI connection. I am currently using the HDMI pass-through feature of the sound bar, and I have not connected the optical cable. My TV input comes only from an Android TV device, which streams content from a DLNA server, as well as Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, etc. The pass-through works perfectly for this application. It will still require a small learning curve for my family to become accustomed to turning the soundbar on prior to use, or perhaps I will need to defeat the auto power off feature (as described in the manual).I did experiment with the CEC settings on my TV to prevent devices from turning on or off unexpectedly, and I think I also needed to set the HDMI audio output setting on my Android device to PCM, Dolby Digital, or DTS. This is all noted in the Yamaha documentation. Again, further trial & error with CEC settings may be helpful, as it would be nice if the sound bar faithfully turned on & off with the TV.I would definitely purchase this sound bar again, especially at the renewed price. I'm considering buying a second for the TV set in the rec room... can I run two of the wireless subs in the same household without problems? Highly recommended.(10/18 - edited for grammar and writing style)11/20 - Owned for over a month now. I’m still extremely pleased. There’s been no weird situations where “it just stopped working” or anything like that.

R2K34ZPFT3QAWQ,B07T5GGR8L,1.0 out of 5 stars Not recommended! Stopped playing audio 3 months after I bought it,mikeg77,1,"Edit: I previously replaced one of these for it stopping working within a few days; this one crapped out on me in 3 months. I was originally passing HDMI signal through it with my AppleTV providing content. It no longer passes through video, and using ARC it no longer plays audio through the speakers. This item responds to the remote control, but it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to: play audio. Recommend “Do Not Buy”I’ve had this sound bar for about a week now, and something I’ve noticed is that the sound can drop out for a half second on streaming video. I have an AppleTV passing through it to a Sony Bravia LED. When the sound drops out for a little longer, the screen shows that the TV is switching to internal speakers. I don’t think this is a cable issue, but I’ll try replacing them.The device is described as providing a voluminous experience, but so far that’s not the case. It doesn’t use a calibration microphone like most Yamaha surround receivers would so it doesn’t do any sort of beam forming to provide surround sound. The built in sub capability is anemic. The sound bar has a sub out, so I have it hooked up to a 12” Klipsch sub and that helps out quite a bit.It only has one 1 HDMI input, so my PS4 may have to get run through a switch, or I’ll connect the PS4 and AppleTV directly to the TV and use the ARC to the sub.I don’t have much use for the built-in Alexa capability as I have a bunch of Echo’s around the apartment, so I can’t really review that.The system is extremely simple though, which is something I like over my previous configuration of running speaker wires; in my new apartment I don’t have a spot to put the rear surrounds anyway. The remote is very straight forward and only has 17 buttons plus 2 directional buttons (subwoofer and volume).The sound quality is overall pretty good, and it can get pretty loud. The 3D Surround function seems to increase the number of channels accessed and output through the speakers. The Clear Voice function definitely increases the volume of voices, but I note a bit of hiss/noise during dialog.That’s all I’ve got for now. Again, good for small spaces, uncomplicated set up, good value. It’s no replacement for a surround sound system, of course. Will edit if I have any other problems.","Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2019",AHVXK7IZOWG2R3SMWLKAS4SHOPZA,True,79,Style: YAS-109BL
R3ULQY922SDP3Y,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars A unit that allows auto shutoff disabled!,William A. Ryder,5,"Ok here's what you should be looking for that I couldn't find anywhere. This unit *does* allow the stupid energy star auto shutoff to be disabled! Yes it sound quality is great for the price point. ARC works well.But I bought it to replace a JBL Soundbar 2.1 which after about 5 minutes of no sound, like when looking for a video on youtube via Roku, the soundbar shuts off! Now I need to duck around with the TV and the bar to turn it back on once I figure out why my volume went up so high (because it's the TV speakers). Believe me you do not want all this. It's unusable! And JBL will NOT let you turn this ""feature"" off. Any manufacturer who forces this situation is producing unusable GARBAGE.Then you go try to find in stated features where anyone else will let you shut it off. It's very hard to find out. It's like they don't want you to know, or to advertise, if a manufacturer builds in a way to disable this energy star auto shutoffoff because the energy police might come get them. I'm the first one to care about the environment but if it causes you to be forced to buy equipment that just doesn't work adequately, what's the point? Just ban the equipment then. Don't make us spend hundreds of dollars just so we can pull all of our hair out everyday when the stupid thing shuts off in the middle of normal use.So this Yamaha *does* allow the stupid auto shutoff to be disabled. It's working flawlessly with my new Sony x900h. It turns on and off with the TV using HDMI ARC which is exactly what you want and expect. And that's it. Simple. Effective. Worth the price.The only other I found that do this for sure seem to be the Bose units...but you're going to pay way up for those. There are a long list of manufacturers like JBL that don't let you disable anything about energy star...and so they will shut off on you and you just have to like it I guess. Heck with what the consumer wants. So if you want to find out who supports or not the only way I've found is reading owner's manuals to see if the setting is there. Most I checked don't have it.Buy this Yamaha if you just want to be safe and don't want to deal with all that kind of crap. I'm confirming for you that Yamaha gives you the control you want. And if you want a brand new nice sounding JBL unit for real cheap drop me a line. It made me cry for letting me down like this.

R3CQ72Z3XXJ410,B07T5GGR8L,3.0 out of 5 stars OK soundbar. Only real option if you want to use an existing subwoofer and also want ARC.,AmazonUser,3,"I had recently upgraded to a 4k TV and had an old vizio soundbar that worked just fine but upon receiving the new tv, found that I would have to use 2 remotes which I absolutely did not want to do. I have the Polk Audio PSW10 subwoofer and wanted to continue using it as I really like the deep punch it has for movie action scenes. Many of the new soundbar packages don't allow an additional subwoofer option and the included sub seems inferior - typical seems to be 6"".Based on these criteria, there were not a whole lot of options available - a soundbar with a sub pre-out and HDMI ARC to enable the one remote option.So I settled on the YAS-109. Through some trial and error I found that the best settings (along with the additional sub) were Clear voice On, TV mode, subwoofer set to -1 and bass ext off.Other than not being able to get very loud compared to my old soundbar, they do the job alright. I just watched Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings in 4k; turning it up all the way and during action scenes, it almost makes me feel like I'm at a theater. The soundbar didn't give out at high volume and remained crystal clear. If however, I move to the kitchen 20 feet away, I wish I could turn up the volume more. Max volume is just not loud enough. My older Vizio soundbar got much louder but did choke at high volume. Perhaps they capped it on purpose knowing full well that the small speakers would not be able to handle anything louder.For the cons, the soundbar's speakers are so tiny that the 'subwoofer' is just a marketing gimmick. If turning up the soundbar's subwoofer at all, it just cannot handle the bass and makes any speech drowned out & woofy. If anything they should have called them drivers. Just by adding an air port doesn't qualify them being called a subwoofer; subwoofer is misleading.The other huge con is the 3d surround option. It is just so laughably bad. No clue how that got greenlighted. Turning it on makes the sound 'appear' wider but it loses all bass and sounds tinny like the speakers within the TV itself. It would have been nice to have the same bass and sound response as without it- but just appear to sound wider; my old vizio soundbar from 2008 had this option and performed so much better in this regard.I also don't really get the sound profiles. Game, Movie and Music have an echo but TV doesn't. Really weird.I can't comment on the Alexa option because we already have another Alexa speaker close by and didn't want them competing so turned the mic off. I also did turn off the power save option so it wouldn't go to sleep. It does turn off when I turn the TV off which is nice.For the current options out there right now, this sound bar is OK. It does the job and fulfilled my criteria. Does it blow me away? lol no. It doesn't have any of the new tech like DTS X or Dolby Atmos but then again it cost a fraction of the price as the ones that do so I can't complain re that.I think a good price point for this speaker is ~$150; abouts what I paid for it. Wait for a sale or try to find it used - like new (damaged box or return but still new). Definitely not worth the $220 new it's going for now.","Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2021",AGII3DOANTJUWG7DBMMAB2EFAZRA,True,23,Style: YAS-109BL

I don't understand why. I am not audiophile, but here are my impressions so far:]Sound always sound muffled and inconsistent in volume. I am watching something, then all of the sudden I have to turn the volume up/down because the show gets too quiet or loud. I can't understand half of what the show says unless I turn the volume up about half way. Using that ""clear voice"" feature is awful. It brings too much separation to the voices from the background of anything I am watching.Woofer - I guess if you really like bass. I hate it. It always sounds like there is this little background thumping sound. It doesn't add to the experience but quite the opposite. It sounds like some idiot with a car full of woofers is sitting in front of my house with his stereo cranked up that I can hear just enough to be annoyed by it.Whatever the ""3D audio is"" - it makes everything sound really weird and kind of hollow no matter what mode I use it in. It's ok for sports but that's about the only thing i've used it for so far.I try to keep the settings on Movie mode but I am constantly having to fiddle with settings depending on what I am watching.Overall I feel like this particular sound bar really detracts from my experience. I wish I could return it an purchase something else. My 10 year old Yamaha sound bar sounds much better. Maybe once the speakers have time to break in it will change my opinion, but until then, be prepared to be constantly fiddling the settings and volume level for every show to find one that is moderately acceptable.So, update to my original review. First of all, TCL is about the crappiest brand of TV I have ever owned. Will never purchase another one of their products ever again. 65"" TV developed a fault after 11 months, and they replaced it with a refurbished unit that lasted 3 months and totally died and naturally they didn't care, just told me basically that I was out of luck. I had to buy a new TV. This time I purchased a Samsung Q70A. Beautiful TV. As soon as I hooked it up to the sound bar, it sounded great. It was not muffled; you don't have to turn the volume up to literally 55 or 60 to hear the sound. Since I was convinced the sound bar was the problem, when I ordered the TV I also ordered a new Samsung sound bar for the ""symphony"" feature, but at least now I have this one as a backup.","Reviewed in the United States November 19, 2021",AHXFAG2M6BMMQNHL75WWSETQZ3UQ,True,13,Style: YAS-209BL

R24ZDLY0N72IL0,B07T5GGR8L,3.0 out of 5 stars Great sound quality above its price range; app & remote are subpar; power-save feature annoying,Jon Bates,3,"If you’re looking for a soundbar with integrated subwoofer and 3D sound with price as your top consideration, the overall audio quality is much better than others in this price range (both in television/movie context and when playing music through the bar). The breadth of input options is a big plus, and the placement of inputs as well as a ‘notch’ indentation at the top-rear of the soundbar makes it extremely convenient to access the two HDMI ports, optical audio port, ethernet connection and USB port (of value if you’re someone who prefers to do manual firmware updates) without unmounting the entire bar if you need to swap cables or add a connection.The WiFi setup process was straightforward and I was able to do it on the first attempt; WiFi connectivity has been stable and without any of the disconnections or repeated hassle of re-entering credentials that makes so many devices a hassle to own.Unfortunately, the mobile apps (Android/iOS) are terrible; I installed the app on both platforms, and neither make it easy to manage and control this soundbar from your phone or tablet. The interface is primitive, and Yamaha clearly did not invest much effort in thinking about how to organize the app. There is nothing intuitive about the icons, their placement, identifying what is informational vs. an icon you click to see additional options. I’m sure Yamaha saw integration with Alexa, Tidal, Spotify and QQ Music as valuable features to market this product, but I would easily trade whatever limited benefit these integrations offer for an app that didn’t require me to guess where to click (and then navigate three clicks deep into the app) just to get to the screen where controls for 3D Surround, Sound Program, Clear Voice option and Subwoofer Volume are buried.Finally, this soundbar includes a power-saving mode that turns the speaker off when you haven’t interacted with it via the remote or app for a while. Because there is no control I’ve been able to find in the app or on the remote to disable the power-saving more—or adjust the amount of time before it shuts off—I have had several infuriating moments when streaming a couple episodes of a series when the soundbar would turn off. More frustrating is that I connect the bar to my television via HDMI, with the soundbar connected between my TV and streaming box. When it abruptly powers off, it triggers the TV to try to find another input source and/or turns off my streaming box.The workaround is kind of ridiculous: every 15-20 minutes, I have to remember to push a button on the remote whether or not I need to adjust something. If I forget and I’m watching something that runs over an hour, I’m going to have to go through the hassle of powering it back on, switching my TV input back to HDMI, and so forth. It’s a great idea in terms of conserving power consumption, but Yamaha should know better than to integrate a feature without any user controls to disable or change the time before it goes off.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2022",AFUG2HCLSHAU7P34OFFSUJDQYT4A,True,18,Style: YAS-109BL

However, the setup instructions for network connection and Alexa setup need some work. In the first place, having to download and use a mobile app is awkward, cumbersome and uses precious memory on my phone. Why they don't supply a Windows app that can be used on a wireless computer is beyond me. Secondly, the instructions in the setup guide are minimal to the point of incomplete. Here are the instructions for Alexa setup.An Amazon account is required to use Amazon Alexa and the unitmust be connected to a network. Use the Sound Bar Controller app toenter your Amazon account information and log into the service.However, the instructions on how to connect to the network were vague and incomplete. They did not mention that first you have to connect the mobile device to the soundbar's private wireless network and use that to find your wireless network with internet access to complete the process. I started a live chat with Yamaha tech support to try to get help but the support agent kept telling me to log on to my Amazon account (which can only be done over my home network, not the soundbar's network). The support person was of absolutely no help and finally told me he was escalating my problem to a higher level tech who would call me in 24-48 hours. He provided me with a case number for reference. I asked him to email me a transcript of the chat so I could reference the case number. But when I got the email, he had only sent the first half of the chat and the case number was not present so I had no way to provide it to the next agent to whom I spoke.In the meantime I continued to try to access my wireless network and set up the soundbar. At some point in the process I received a message on my phone that said that my phone was ""connected to Netname, the soundbar was connected to Netname, please connect the phone to Netname."" Netname being the name of my wireless net. So I was being told to connect my phone to the net to which it was already connected.At this point I decided that the soundbar had gotten into a state where I could proceed and disconnected/reconnected the power to the unit. I think this step enabled what happened next.By trial and error I finally deduced that to connect to my wireless network I had to use the soundbar's private network to find my wireless network and then enter the SSID and password. Once I did this, everything started working. When the next level tech called 2 days later, I told him that all had been resolved.From this I would say that:1. The mobile app should be improved with better instructions2. The setup guide should be improved with better instructions including pictures/screenshots3. The reference manual should be improved with better instructions, the including pictures/screenshots4. The tech support people should be better trained to listen to customers and be more knowledgeable in order to better serve the customers.

R3E1XUGIKBB92J,B07T5GGR8L,"5.0 out of 5 stars Sound Clarity, Yes...",Don A,5,"Bottom line before my review...buy it!We are currently using the Yamaha YAS-109 sound bar for dual purpose; outside and RV. Under our RV-Port I like to here music when outside working and this is an great option. It can stream music from our house WiFi or from music via bluetooth on my phone. Having ALEXA in the unit (works only with internet connection), it's nice to get updates, change the music selection all with voice control. Surprisingly, under a metal RV port 24' x 40' with 15' ceiling, there is no problem hearing the music clearly. I move it from RV port to Car port with the same results and fairly quick connection to our house internet for WiFi streaming after re-plugging it in to AC power; less than 1 minute. The second accomplishment for us was to obtain better sound quality in our Truck Camper from the HDTV and music source. We power the unit from our batteries and inverter when dry camping and always have great music now! Via a bluetooth device connected on the back of the DISH satellite receiver (optional from Amazon) the Yamaha sound bar connects for great sound wireless anywhere we are parked. You can also use the HDMI connection from the HDTV to the Sound Bar if you don't want to 'pair' wireless technology. Pairing does require a smart phone one-time to connect the unit to a voice/music source. So far, re-pairing has 'not' been necessary after power has been removed. Therefore, in our case, pair once and power up and listen to your source music or TV programming. Since 100% of our camper is powered off a 3000 watt inverter (back feed on all 120 vac outlets), we watch satellite TV and use Sirius XM music from DISH TV over the sound bar in the middle of no where! If you have a Sirius XM account (i.e. in your vehicle or house), you can connect ALEXA, set up via a CODE and stream Sirius XM programming from your house or other WiFi connection; no additional fees. All you need to do is say...""ALEXA, play the BLEND on Sirius XM"" or ""play the top play list on Amazon Music"" and you're on your way! Instruction manual is not the greatest but should get you connected. This unit can also be purchased with a bass sub-woofer for house use. Oh, the unit can be mounted on a wall vertical (template included) or sit flat on a counter or entertainment center. In my RV case, I had to weld up brackets to hold on the rear-mounting screws and cradle the bottom due to the wall angle. Initially, I contacted Yamaha for a support question regarding ALEXA (couldn't reconnect), referred to 2nd level support which via email took over a week; Not Good! In the mean time, found out ALEXA has an ON/OFF button on the units control panel...make sure it's turned ON for 'voice' control. No, it's not a $1000+ BOSE surround system like we have in the house but it is a 'major' improvement for those that want something much smaller, affordable and still produce great sound. We are glad we selected this Yamaha Sound Bar and hope you do also!Update: 7 months later, works great!","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2019",AFAQPKW6LLD2A2NO7BALA2HU25BQ,True,35,Style: YAS-109BL

This sound system would not do things like ""go to Netflix"" or ""rewind"" or the usual things we use our Alexa fire cube for. I tried putting the cube in line with the sound bar, but that didn't work either. The fire cube would no longer do its usual functions. Once the sound bar was disconnected, and the fire cube directly hooked to the TV, the Alexa functions were back to normal. I had to return my sound bar because of these issues.

I have some hearing loss so this allows me to hear more clearly with the volume lower than just using the TV speakers or switching to bluetooth headphones. If the controller gets misplaced by tiny hands I can control the volume and audio settings from my phone using the app.The Bad:Does not support Enhanced AC3 also known as Dolby Digital Plus, DD+, E-AC-3, and EC-3. This format is becoming much more common. You'll get no audio and will have to power off the soundbar or potentially disable audio passthrough which should encode the audio to a supported format. I'm not sure how to do this currently and your mileage may vary depending on hardware and software, but I don't think this is done at the soundbar.Finally, Issues with the app. The soundbar will randomly stop being detected by the app even though the soundbar is connected to my home network using ethernet (hardwired not WiFi). This happens often enough to be a nuisance and from what I've read has been a problem for a while with the APP. Apparently the only fix is to reset the device and readd to the APP each time this happens.","Reviewed in the United States March 10, 2023",AGISU4JNZZGA2R57ZSLQQOUMKC6A,True,7,Style: YAS-209BL

RTXPX0WY34TCS,B07T5GGR8L,4.0 out of 5 stars Good clear sound,Ian F. White,4,"I had an older IG soundbars and wanted to upgrade. I read dozens of reviews and tests. For my budget this seemed perfect. Very easy to set up and connect to internet and Bluetooth. Chose a 4K blu ray film to watch. After playing with the settings I settled on movie and +3 subwoofer along with clear voice and 3D surround. I was very happy with the sound production. My one small criticism is that the surround sound could be more pronounced. Not enough separation between left and right channels. Base is just right. Not too overpowering. Music was really good as well, played via Bluetooth and my iPhone.I’d recommend this for anyone on a budget. Dolby atmos would have been nice but beggars can’t be choosers! 😄I’ve had this sound bar for some time now and thought I’d update my review.To be honest I’m a little disappointed. To hear it reasonably it needs to be at least half full volume and even with clear voice turned on it’s still sometimes difficult to understand every word that’s said. The subwoofer is my main moan. I have it turned to +4 (the maximum as it starts at ~4, goes to 0 and then +4) and once you’ve gotten used to it…an hour or so, it seems to disappear into the background. There are no dramatic booms and bangs while watching an action movie. This is a big subwoofer as they go and the sound seems weak.Overall, if I was a rich man I’d go out and buy something more powerful. If you buy this, don’t expect wonders although it is an improvement on the TV speakers.","Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2021",AFC74CNI74OWBOY6TPLDJIHLZWDA,True,0,Style: YAS-209BL

To be honest this is the best sounding sound bar I’ve ever heard in my life I’ve heard some very expensive soundbars with similar quality of sound. If you are looking for amazing sound quality I’d recommend these. The bass is very nice and the vocals are loud and including whatever else is going on in the background it picks up everything very nicely. Almost makes you believe you got a surround sound and not a soundbar. Anyways if you buy this you won’t regret it.

R1NIF2UCRBCJAA,B07T5GGR8L,3.0 out of 5 stars The sound isn't bad but the functionality leave much to be desired,AnAmazonShopper,3,"I originally had this in my apartment, hanging on the wall, behind my couch, and connected to my projector via optical cable. Alexa had issues with staying connected. However, I didn't use Alexa very much with it so it didn't really bother me. Since then, I have gotten a house and moved the sound bar to my home gym to connect to the TV mounted in there and for music. Now, I use Alexa all the time. The problem is, I want to say, Alexa, play music everywhere so it plays on all of my alexa devices in the house. This speaker doesn't show up on the list of available speakers. Which is a huge bummer. So this sound bar will probably be relegated to the basement TV which doesn't really get any use.As a stand-alone alexa device, it isnt't bad. However, if you want to integrate it into a smart home setup, you'll probably want to skip it. It is worth mentioning that since we moved, I haven't had any connectivity issues with it. Maybe because my internet is more stable here than it was in my apartment and my modem doesn't go out all the time. It can be a real pain to get this sound bar connected to the internet.The sound from the bar is pretty good, I can't really give it more than 3 stars, because it doesn't go above any average expectation I had for the price.If you're using it for movies, you'll want a wired connection. There is a lot of lag, especially with youtube, and no way to set a delay of any kind to compensate for it. Bluetooth for movies or videos is complete rubbish, bluetooth on this device should only be used for music, or audiobooks. In which case, you have Alexa and amazon music integration.In sum,If you want a good-sounding bar, with a wired connection for movies, and maybe some audio streaming then this is probably a good fit for you.If you're hoping for any kind of smarthome integration, or an wireless-audio option to bluetooth to your Kindle FireTV Stick (or preferred home streaming media device) I can not recommend it.

Took a lot of trial and error to figure this out and so far the only way to get the sound from the TV to the Soundbar working again is to unplug everything. I have easy access to my surge protector so it's not a big deal and easy to power down and back up again. I'm not sure if this setup is supposed to work so I'm not really complaining because the dual sound outputs work for me.I also have the soundbar connected to my old Polk PSW505 base speaker via standard RCA audio cable and WOW does the base POP.

No equalizer nor even bass treble etc. Just volume control for the sub and audio ""scenes"" (ie movie, TV show, music) with no explanation what they do.With everything set up for ARC the soundbar turns completely off - not to standby - when turning the TV off. So ARC won't turn the soundbar back on. Edit: found instructions online for disabling this feature.And physically speaking if your TV is mounted on the wall you can't mount the soundbar right up under it because of the way it mounts. And the soundbar buttons are on the TOP of the soundbar instead of the end or front. So if you want to be able to use the physical buttons or see the indicator lights you'll have to leave a few inches of space between the TV and soundbar.And if you're like me and like good wire management, this thing sucks. They don't give you a channel on the back to give space between the wall and soundbar to run wires. And the power cord has to be bent at a harsh angle so it doesn't hit the wall. There are no brackets you just hang it on two screws in the wall, so it's not very secure. And good luck getting it level because of the cheap way they designed the mounts. And of course the bottom is ugly which sucks if you mount it to the wall. They clearly paid zero attention to the design for people who will actually mount it to a wall.","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2022",AFOWK6JTP73AJEPBSWYOTK3OV6CA,True,2,Style: YAS-209BL

Downloading the app, updating the firmware helped some of this, but it still sometimes shut off and wouldn't respond or turn back on using arc or even it's remote. Swapping sources on the app once or twice would generally wake it back up, but it is still a tedious. I did some hard googling and found the auto shutoff could be turned off. Just google ""turn off yas 209 auto shutoff"". It's the Input button i think and the power button for 5 seconds and the clearvoice icon start to glow which means it's disabled. I now no longer wanted to return it. It's a great sounding bar that get pretty loud and the bass ext really adds a solid low end. After reading other reviews as annoyed as I was I hope this helps some people. It's honestly a really good soundbar and it's too bad these small changes aren't openly presented as I imagine a lot of people would enjoy it a lot more.

R2GRRCSVRM4919,B07T5GGR8L,3.0 out of 5 stars You can do much better sonically,Roger Moffatt,3,"My wife hates wires, oh and large speakers, so was on the hunt for a relatively wire free soundbar based audio system for our new house and second TV room. Setup was relatively pain-free, although had to resort to reading instructions for getting it connected to my local mesh network which is 5G/2.4G. Functionality wise this is pretty neat - the built in Alexa integration works well, although can't seem to change the wake word as I can with the other devices around the house - but that's no bad thing as at least when I talk to Alexa, only the sound bar gets the instruction. Like the independent sub-woofer controls and it all looks the part and has fewer wires than my previous system. So why only 3 stars? In our house the competition is a small class-D digital amplifier and a pair of floor standing speakers (hence all the wires) and it completely wipes the floor with the Yamaha sonically. Yes the subwoofer is nice, but the mid-range is completely muddled regardless of what EQ setting (Movie/TV/Music/Sports/Game/Stereo) and the sound stage is surprisingly narrow. Disappointing I'd say. That said, it is of course a huge step up from the TV speakers and also a huge improvement over a previous basic soundbar we tried that lasted a week before I couldn't bear the sound any more, so it's not terrible - but by comparison with a real hi-fi system, despite the technology and the number of drivers, it makes a bit of a mess of the sound to my ears. I'm going to keep it for now, but relegate to our second TV rather than the one we would use more of the time.

Then I was off to the running.Sound: Honestly, I'm not audiophile but I can tell the difference between low quality bass heavy speakers and something that produces quality sound.

It's clean, minimalistic on space, and produces crisp and well rounded sound. This is also placed in my great room and has no issues filling the large space with sound.Alexa integration: I'm heavily invested in Alexa. I have them everywhere. The voice activation works flawlessly so far and she's picked up my voice without issue. After reading some reviews I was worried it would be a clunky integration but this has not been the case. It just works, same as any other echo I have.Controls: The capacitive touch buttons on the bar and remote work without issue. I did have to manually switch over to the TV input to get the ARC passthrough to work but it's been fine ever since.Overall this is a quality system and lives up to the reviews. If you want a hi-fi Alexa that also works great for home theater I'd have a hard time coming up with any other features I'd need that aren't already in this package. This is easily worth the price and I'd probably have paid a little more. Frankly I'm considering replacing my 5.1 system given how small the footprint is and the sound quality you get out of it.","Reviewed in the United States March 10, 2021",AEUY3HRDGWFVRLL3WVV7JTTXTNUA,True,6,Style: YAS-209BL

I looked at various speaker types and designs until I found this design by Yamaha, ATS-2090. Since I wanted a solid quality sound at my desk and not wanting a dedicated stereo in my office, a sound bar seemed the best solution. The audio ""out"" from the PC and the HDMI ""in"" on the sound bar apparently aren't compatible, but both devices have optical... which windows 11 calls Digital Audio (S/PDIF), Toshiba invented it back in 1983 (TOSLINK). My ASUS mobo has it and the ATS-2090 has it, so music fills my office. The ATS-2090 also has Alexa, so music sources are not limited to the PC. I mounted the soundbar under my desk with the provided mounting template and the subwoofer sits on the floor under my desk. I installed the Yamaha sound bar app on my phone, and the included remote work equally well to control the volume and modes, as well as keeping track of any software updates available for Alexa or the ATS-2090. I am very happy that I chose the Yamaha ATS-2090 as my speaker and Alexa controlling the blacklight and lava lamp in my office (via a smart outlet) is just the icing on the cake. My video game sounds are on the next level when the headset starts to make my head hurt...

I'm not doing any Alexa or apps or software updates or anything. I just plugged it into my TV via the optical cable and my two subwoofers (one on each side of the room, with a splitter cable to connect them both to the single sub out). I have a big living room, and the sound is satisfactory. It's not as surround-sound as the much more expensive but dated soundbar I used to use, but it cost less than $250. I like how the remote lets you control both the sub and soundbar volume independently, and that I don't have to bother with the app (which everyone seems to hate). I can now play a Netflix show without having to manually change the audio format every single episode, and I didn't have to spend a ton of money to update my entire setup to do it. It took me about 10 minutes to switch it out, and it's worked without a glitch for a couple of weeks now. That's good enough for 4 stars in my book.

At first, the soundbar kept connecting to the TV with bluetooth and not HDMI ARC. Frustrating for a good while to the point where I actually packed up the soundbar to return it. Then I decided to give it another try. I fished for answers in the manual ( which is not greatly clear) and found out that I needed to reset the soundbar and, boom, got the ARC set up. In fairness the soundbar was previously used so it may have needed the reset. Still the fix was a bit elusive. I had a subwoofer on hand from my 5.1 surround sound set, and hooked it up to the soundbar. Now, finally, the sound is pleasing with great depth. Big improvement from TV speakers. Still miss my 5.1 set up, but don't miss the wires. Now everything is compact, behind the TV. For $170, like new I am very happy. Took a star off for the frustrating set up, but the soundbar itself is very, very good. Doesn't beat a 5.1 setup of course, but very good for what it does.

Our LG TV is on a swing-arm wall mount, so we had to attach the Yamaha to the bottom of the TV using a special bracket, which Amazon helpfully suggested. That was fine.Have not managed, after several weeks, to really figure out how to modulate the volume control, in terms of the voice thing, the subwoofer, the volume control on LG remote, the volume control on Yamaha remote, etc. The owners manual, such as it is, is beyond worthless.So, when music plays on a TV show, it's like you're in a concert hall. 5 seconds later, the music has subsided and a character on the TV show is talking, and you can barely hear them. So then you grab the Yamaha remote and try hitting the voice button and all that, and you don't really know if it's engaging, because there's nothing but some inscrutable lights flashing at the base of the unit.I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually.

R3UAXTHK99QQVI,B07T5GGR8L,3.0 out of 5 stars Adequate,Ryan,3,"It's been a year since we bought it, so I figure it's time for a year's ownership review. I purchased this because listening to the TV's speakers was just awful and it allowed me to make use of my Klipsch sub woofer that was collecting dust. With the addition of my sub, it just adds a dimension to the sound that isn't achievable by itself. The lows by itself are fine for a bedroom (get a sub for your living room), the mids are nice, and the highs are ""Tin'y"" sounding. The sound adjustments help somewhat, but ultimately there is no escaping that ""tin'y"" sound with the highs. It's hard to find a happy medium between sound effects and people speaking in movies. Voices seem to get lost a lot, even with a lot of adjusting. The remote is almost worthless if you've got it sitting on an entertainment center, so we just use the app. Alexa is hit or miss, we usually end up repeating ourselves and if we're listening to a program, forget it, it struggles to hear you. I know this all sounds bad, but it's not...not really. For the price, I'm actually content with it for the most part. It's not a living room solution though. If I had to do it again, I'd have gone Bose or Sonos. That said, it'll make a nice upgrade for the bedroom when I order a higher end system.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2022",AFBWDERTAKGOTX4PXVNOMFNOXHEQ,True,0,Style: YAS-109BL

We listen to music a lot on TV, Alexa or through external inputs like DVD. Sound quality is great and clear. For watching movies, the surround sound is great.I had however lots of problems with TV and Alexa getting frequently disconnected until I figured out solution hard way. I have connected to our late model Samsung TV through ARC. There is some combination of turning on- off Alexa and Tv sounds that disconnects from the source. Then I have to reset the soundbar which the user guide does not tell you how. Also the you have to know how to reconnect the Alexa using mobile app if the network gets disconnected. All these, once you learn how, are manageable but require some technical expertise.Here is the frustration part. Yamaha tech support is very poor, a 1 star at best. I called them 5-6 times and each time the wait is 1-1.5 hr! They do not have an efficient queuing system. The recorded message which is an advertisement for their drum based products is extremely annoying. If you keep the volume on your phone low, when the tech support comes on, you may not hear them and they just hang up after your hour long wait! Also the tech support only showed me how to reset the soundbar but could not help on Alexa. She said she will have to an audio specialist call me which they never did.The firmware on mobile app says it is version 1.0.6. But if you check on the website, there is a version 2.76 available which supposedly fixes lot of these issues. The tech support does not know anything about it! I went through the process of updating the firmware however the mobile app still shows old version only!

R8N4YX8H6OVC,B07T5GGR8L,4.0 out of 5 stars A very good soundbar that is not without flaws,Brett,4,"Update 9/12/19: There’s a firmware update that I swear adds significantly more bass to the system (am I imagining this?) and appears to address the sound skips. Curious to see what others say.Original review: I started with a Sonos Beam but was unimpressed with the audio quality. I next tried the $700 Samsung Q70R, which sounded really good on Atmos, but had tinny vocals on standard content and a lip sync delay that I couldn't fix. So third time is the charm, but not without issues. The Yamaha sounds very good when you set it to Movie mode, turn the sub to max, turn on bass extension and turn on Clear Voice. Most importantly, it just works! The lip sync is perfect, it turns to the correct mode every time, and the power and volume can be controlled by the Apple Tv remote no problem. The major issue is, if you only use ARC, the audio cuts off for a few seconds every so often. This has been mentioned in other reviews, so it's a clear problem that Yamaha needs to address. The current solution to this is to plug Arc from the bar to the Tv and then to use a second HDMI cable from the bar to your source. 95% of the content I watch is on Apple Tv, so this is fine, but if I want to use the PS4 without audio skips, I need to unplug the HDMI from the Apple Tv and hook it up to the PS4, which is a pain. Also, the app is terrible. I can only get it to even connect if I link my phone wifi to the bar, as opposed to my home network. Of the three bars I tried, this is easily my favorite, and the cheapest. It's a good value. But Yamaha definitely needs a firmware update for the Arc audio issue.","Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2019",AFGDNXCQ5ERYP42XZ63MTS5WGUCA,True,153,Style: YAS-209BL

I would like to see a universal remote included, for people who might hook this up via toslink. I use CEC over HDMI which mostly works great.Audio quality is usually better than I expected.

The surround is really convincing but the treble levels make it hard to keep it in that setting for long. It is significantly better than the tv speakers though, and the Bluetooth is really well done, I can connect very easily and consistently from my phone. I haven't used the Alexa much but it does turn the volume up and down by voice command even at higher volumes, I'm impressed by that.

The sound is surprisingly good. As a professional sound engineer, clearly this is not a replacement for professional speakers in a large venue, but for a bedroom, it sounds very nice with surprisingly good bass for its size, and good vocal clarity. We have it switched to music mode all the time, obviously. The Alexa feature is convenient (moved the other Alexa to another room).However we are frustrated by two things. First the iPhone controller app seems to have trouble connecting to the sound bar. If I power down the sound bar, then power up again, it will connect for a few minutes and even play music. But if the app reloads for whatever reason, whether 5 minutes later or a day later, the app simply will not connect without restarting the sound bar. Yet (get this), audio continues to play from the phone over WiFi! In fact, we couldn't STOP audio from playing because the app couldn't find the sound bar it was actually playing through at the time! Really? This happens every time and is completely repeatable. Was this app even tested? We finally gave up on using the app and moved to bluetooth, which brings up issue number 2....Apparently the sound bar can only connect to one bluetooth device at a time, which makes sense for playing music, but unlike other bluetooth products from other manufacturers, if my wife's phone is connected--even if she's not using that connection--there's no way I can connect to the speaker until she goes into her bluetooth settings and releases the connection by selecting disconnect. Yes, just choosing another output to play to is insufficient, you must go into the bluetooth settings and disconnect. That seems pretty hostile.Those are my two complaints. With those shortcomings aside, we love the sound and looks of the product.

There is a ""Clear Voice"" setting that you can turn on - it helps a bit with that issue, but if you need to have an artificial boost on frequencies for dialogue, that might be a hint that the soundbar isn't quite up to snuff.I am utilizing the HDMI ARC feature - the only strange thing I have seen is that when the TV turns on, once in a while the sound bar will NOT turn on automatically with it. When it happens it is annoying, but manually turning the sound bar on fixes the issue, so it isn't terrible.All in all, if you are looking for a quality sound bar, this might be OK if you have a small room and have to hook up a subwoofer as well.

Had house full of people for the Super Bowl and we had it’s volume max’d at 100. Granted, this may have been a limitation of the TV’a ARC interface, but still. Music volume seems okay. Of course that’s compared to the Echo Dot’s speaker, so low standards.If you don’t use Alexa, make sure you have the Yamaha app handy otherwise switching inputs is a bit of a pain as the controls are hard to see especially if it’s installed rather high.If you do use Alexa, make sure you have the Yamaha app handy otherwise switching inputs is a bit of a pain. Alexa is my biggest gripe. Although the Yamaha and Alexa work really well at playing streaming music, getting back to any other source is almost impossible. Not really sure what happened but it seemed to work for a while but not anymore. In reviewing the manual, it quotes exactly what your supposed to say to get it to switch inputs. And, like I said, it worked for a while, but now, the only way to switch inputs is either with the app or the local buttons. Frustrating.A big feature we hoped it had, but again, took a chance that it would but found no info in my research, was “Announce” and “Drop-in”. Sadly, it does not.Hopefully all of the Alexa “issues” can be remedied with a firmware update.For now, I will be disabling the Alexa feature and returning my Echo Dot back to the living room.","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2020",AHBEORW5MCLRJBP3NQH23LJAVIEQ,True,3,Style: YAS-209BL

Nice, high quality sound, but if you have trouble the tech support and documentation is appallingly bad, and based on the issues with my Roku, the manual is probably inaccurate. No volume indicator on the soundbar and poorly designed remote.Pros:I bought this to replace an old 5.1 system I had. The sound is very impressive. It's not true surround sound, of course, but I love the sound.Cons:1. Extremely lacking manual and poor tech support.I followed the extremely minimal directions but my installation had a problem with the sound dropping out every few minutes. The manual is basically really just an illustration. There's no FAQ or troubleshooting info. So it was no help. The online video is mostly a sales video. Again, no help there.So I called tech support. Their solution was to replace my HDMI cables. Seriously?! Well, fortunately I had spares, so I did, but as I expected it didn't make any difference. Basically, the only solution tech support could offer was the equivalent of turning the system on and off (Something else I did.), so tech support was no help and a waste of my time.Eventually, I fixed it on my own. Their manual says to run the HDMI cable to the sound bar from your streaming box (I have a Roku.). That's not the set up I had on my 5.1 system. So I went back to my former set up, running my Roku HDMI to my TV not the Yamaha sound bar.That fixed it. No thanks to Yamaha.2. Poor soundbar designThere's no volume gauge on the soundbar. No volume level indicator. No numbers. No volume bar. Just an indication the volume is going up or down, so you have no idea what your volume level is. I guess they expect you to use the iphone app. But I prefer using the remote that comes with it. Imagine that.3. The remote is poorly designedThe volume control is at the bottom of the remote, so rather than the remote resting in the palm of your hand you have to hold it in your fingers.Verdict:I do not recommend. Nice, high quality sound, but if you have trouble the tech support and documentation is appallingly bad. And based on the issues with my Roku, the manual is probably inaccurate. No volume indicator and poorly designed remote.I would have sent the system back, but it's honestly a hassle to repackage.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2021",AGHJO3F6VGG7F5WJB5U246FF7SNQ,True,1,Style: YAS-209BL

R2B05ZYA5ZWD89,B07T5GGR8L,2.0 out of 5 stars Way too sibilant,E,2,"I was hoping this soundbar would be a decent option for TV, music, etc., given that Yamaha has a lot of experience with making well-respected audio hardware. I found these really lacking in the lows and mids, and way too sharp in the highs. If you wanna hear every detail in every cymbal-hit in songs you didn't even realize had cymbals, this is the setup for you. If you want full, well-balanced sound, none of the 6 preset EQ options this sound bar offers will satisfy. And, if you're like me and can't stand sharp, piercing, noises whenever someone on TV says a word containing the letter ""s"", stay far away from this soundbar. Also, it felt like the subwoofer was too loud and boomy when I didn't want to hear it, but wasn't putting out enough when I did want to hear it.I really wanted this to be good enough. I wasn't expecting to be blown away, I just wanted something decent, but this just isn't it. I imagine all these 5-star reviewers haven't watched their TVs with anything other than the built-in speakers, and this is certainly better than TV speakers, but it's just not good enough to be charging almost $200. I will say, the virtual surround mode was somewhat impressive. It really did make the soundstage feel so much bigger, but it also added a lot of reverb and generally degraded the overall sound quality and clarity further. This was my first sound bar, so I don't know if this one's better or worse than other soundbars – it seems like it's really difficult to make tiny little speakers sound like they're not tiny little speakers – but I can confidently say that this soundbar is worse than stereo speakers that cost half the price or less.","Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2023",AFKPPUQI6WDOIEDDBNXIYXJXARXQ,True,2,Style: ATS-2090BL-R
RPEOEDN7F56ZJ,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Problems connecting to TV help,Dr. Clutch,5,"We bought our Yamaha YAS-109 for Christmas this year. I found it odd that it comes with an optical sound cable and the Quick Start Guide doesn’t mention the optical cable at all. Instead the Guide explains how to connect via HDMI, which is not included. The sound bar is HDMI ARC and CEC compatible so if your TV is also capable of these 2 features you should be able to control the sound bar volume from your TV remote. That was a major consideration when we chose this sound bar. When I finally got it working it was a major improvement over the TV’s built in speakers.Unfortunately, connecting it to our TV via HDMI ARC did not work. There was no sound from the TV and the TV’s CEC settings menu did not detect a CEC device connected. Lots of reading online and plenty of juggling settings and cables later I figured out that the cable box is interfering with the TV’s ability to detect the sound bar over the HDMI connection. If you have this problem you can disconnect all inputs to the TV except the sound bar and if the TV then detects the sound bar you can reconnect 1 TV input at a time until you find the offending device. Our TV is a TCL ROKU 5S series and the offending cable box is a Samsung SMT-H4372 originally from Time Warner. Until I can get a different cable box I am using the optical cable and the sound bar remote for volume control. Hope this helps someone with a similar problem.","Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2020",AGCHHNEDDRPBRZE6A23O46QGDUMA,True,3,Style: YAS-109BL

R2HWP05G32HEQR,B07T5GGR8L,1.0 out of 5 stars FAILED after 2 weeks....,CLG,1,"UPDATE: The soundbar abruptly stopped passing the HDMI signal in the middle of a movie after two weeks of light use and the screen went black and the sound stopped. Switching the setup to HDMI ARC audio only did not solve the audio problem. Troubleshooting isolated the problem to the HDMI output hardware. Clearly a quality control issue. Very very disappointed in Yamaha. Will be returning this and will get a different system (Yamaha no more).INITIAL REVIEW: First understand my star rating: 5 stars for home theater sound, 1 star for music = 3 stars. Yamaha is a brand I have loved for over 30 years for their great products in the music world, so when I was looking for a soundbar which could deliver both great home theater sound AND also music, I was drawn to this soundbar. If you are looking for a home theater experience and don't want to hassle with multiple speakers, it does a pretty good job (great clarity, good but not overwhelming bass, nice reproduction across the range); the virtual surround feature was a bit lost in my large room, but I blame the space, not the bar for that, and it was still a nice auditory experience. Sadly, music reproduction from bluetooth streaming sources was poor, due to harsh and often distorted treble at the mid to upper ranges on most tracks (rock, jazz, classical, acoustic), including on vocals. This was at its worst when using the 3D surround feature, but was not fixed by using either the ""music"", or ""stereo"" modes provided, or by a firmware update. There is no other equalizer option. Both Amazon Music HD and Apple iTunes files had the same issue. In contrast, when I connected my vinyl phonograph (TEAC TN300, using its built in pre-amp (RCA out, using an inexpensive RCA to TOS-Link converter, so I could make use of the only other single port (optical) on the bar...HDMI is the main of course), it did not have this problem and actually sounded very nice. Go figure, but I am guessing it has to do with the reproduction of the compressed (and undoubtedly loudness adjusted) digital streaming files through this unit vs. the more natural dynamic range of the analogue to digital signal from the vinyl. A bit disappointed on this front, because my plans are to use it both for music and TV. I am probably expecting too much at this price point, considering the feature set provided, but I wanted more from my old friend Yamaha. I don't use Alexa, so I can't comment on that. Set up was straight forward using the enclosed quick start guide, with easy pairing of the wireless sub. The iPhone control app is pretty worthless, as it offers far fewer features that the small physical remote provided. I will probably keep the bar for now and rely mostly on my vinyl collection for music in that space; still, its too bad that streaming will not be a great option.","Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2020",AGW4RPFBODN5WGKRCQ7M3FASEC6Q,True,10,Style: YAS-209BL

It seems to be functioning just fine now, and the Alexa system works okay. Still, I'm not convinced this was a good buy. 1) There is no midrange and the sound from the bar is tinny, which is fine for voice but annoying for rock music. 2) The ""music"" setting appears to just add reverb. 3) There is no way to adjust the eq, which I realize is pretty normal for soundbars, but still annoys me. 4) The subwoofer isn't as tight as other reviews led me to believe, but rather muddy: again good for movies not for music. 5) When playing music on Alexa, it will randomly start playing again after I've told it to stop (our echo dot doesn't do this). 6) The wifi only works on 2.4 ghz, so to use the app on the smartphone, I first have to go into wifi settings and switch it from my default 5ghz network to my 2.4 ghz.I don't have the money for a nicer system right now, and at least we can finally hear the voices on TV/movies, so I guess this will have to do for a few years.","Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2019",AHJVZ7ORKEL4ORHIVXTLJYPFAQQQ,True,7,Style: YAS-209BL

Yamaha is a trusted brand but I'm pretty certain the people who designed the software and the app do not use this product themselves. Here is a list of issues that bug me everytime I use, and I mean, everytime: -1) the soundbar turns off by itself everytime you pause a movie for more than 5 minutes. Why? It's not like the soundbar is running on battery, is it? And when the soundbar is turned off, you'll have to restart the program again.2) the app's design is retarded. To set the program for TV, movie, etc. and to adjust the volume, you'll have to navigate through multiple screens everytime. Meanwhile, the volume adjustment occupies the entire phone screen for whatever reason. All these functions could easily have fit into a single screen. The app developer obviously have not learnt Human-Computer Interfaces. You're supposed to make it convenient and minimise the number of taps, not maximise it!3) the app does not remember your source of audio input. I have it on HDMI. Yet it will switch back to TV as the source everytime after it's turned off. Why? This is a soundbar, we care about the quality of our audio enough to buy a soundbar. Why would the source not be defaulted to HDMI but digital optical audio instead? Better still, remember our choices!4) I'm using the soundbar for my TV. I don't wait to navigate past your Spotify or whatevernot just so i can adjust the volume of the movie I am watching, and set the type of program. Why can't you just put the volume control as the first screen?5) the app could not be used when it's connected to other WiFi that has been inter-routed behind the scenes. My other WiFi connected appliances etc - security cameras, lightbulbs, switches and even my vacuum, are smart enough to not impede my WiFi setup but Yamaha? Why? You're the lone exception and that speaks a lot!6) why does the app need my location to operate? Again, here you're the lone exception!

Setting this device up and keeping it working just not worth it.","Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2020",AEWPJLKNL7DFCNK2QLLFQFULZZPA,True,1,Style: YAS-209BL
R1OCRGPXFA37PQ,B07T5GGR8L,2.0 out of 5 stars Sounds great but doesn't work well with TV.,CCRN-r-us,2,"Positives: It sounds great as would expected from a Yamaha. Playing music and watching was a enjoyment.Cons: At first, connection to the TV using HDMI Arc works really well as intended. Downside is that it doesn't indicate what volume level it is in as would from my TV shown with a number. It only show with a ""+"" or ""-"" sign. Upon using it the second day, it stop having any sound coming from the TV. Arc shown it is still working as I can control with volume up or down but no sound at all. I switch to optical connection to the TV cause everything I tried couldn't bring the sound back. There really isn't much I can do. Optical work as intended but not preferred cause I don't want to use a second remote just for the sound when I am watching TV. Optical work for one session only. After I turn off the TV and return later to watch TV again, just like HDMI arc, it stop having any sound again. This time using Yamaha remote for sound doesn't do anything at all. I unplug the power source to the unit to do a ""reset"" and replug it after a short while, it work for a short time then it won't let me adjust any volume (using TV remote through HDMI arc or Yamaha remote) and then while the unit is able to have sound, all the light on the unit disappear. If I unplug and plug it back in, it will work again but same situation.Pretty sad as I like this speaker unit. It greatly enhance my TV viewing experience but I spend more time trouble shooting the unit than watching and enjoy my movies.","Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2021",AHG7LBDSFZME56QHRH6UEU2YJP5Q,True,0,Style: YAS-209BL
R66PKTX66DVV7,B07T5GGR8L,4.0 out of 5 stars Sound is decent,Bernardo,4,Overall it’s not too bad of a sound bar. I purchased it because I wanted an Alexa enabled speaker that I can set up with other Alexa speakers to have sound throughout the house. That feature totally worked. I wasn’t too thrilled with the sound though. I wish there was more control with a custom EQ through the App. Currently it has preset EQ settings that sometimes does not sound that great. Either you can’t really hear the voices on a movie or it has just too much bass. I think if I could adjust the EQ manually this product would have received 5 stars throughout.,"Reviewed in the United States August 28, 2022",AFZEKAAJQII3FLEFGUBDAHTIE6IA,True,3,Style: YAS-209BL

RN2AZGRPA0XY1,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Setup advice,Jeff Owens,5,"Works great, sounds great, price is great. Works just like an echo smart speaker regarding voice commands. For our small house and our use this product is a perfect. NOTE REGARDING SETUP. All the feedback about how hard setup is. All true. Poor documentation, and circular references. I was ready to return it and give up when I disconnected everything and setup as a stand alone device. Remove any HDMI, optical, or USB connection. When I did the app immediately found the soundbar, setup the WiFi, and the Alexa app added the speaker to inventory. Went from BUST to BARGAIN in 3 minutes.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2023",AF7HK46Z6EUEPB5ATXEHIKPPUTIQ,True,8,Style: ATS-2090BL-R
RDQM8WDC2D73B,B07T5GGR8L,"4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty Good, Could Be Better",S. Cooper,4,"Overall this sound bar has been enjoyable. It sometimes shuts itself off, seemingly for no reason but it could be related to an ""automatic standby"" setting that I have disabled so time will tell. The sound quality is good and this fixes my issue where the ""Smart Sound"" on my LG Smart TV makes dialogue completely unintelligible on Blu-rays and HD streaming with surround sound; I can now always hear the dialogue perfectly clear. The 3D settings isn't very desirable and just makes everything sound muddy and extra bass-heavy so I don't really understand the point. The ARC HDMI functionality works well but it doesn't turn on with my TV. My one main complaint is that it takes a long time to move the volume either up or down and there is no digital display so you have to go by the amount of LEDs lit on the unit—not very telling when each LED represents 3 different volumes.","Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2021",AEI5EMRDKBBXMO3G3GFELR5ZHK4A,True,0,Style: YAS-109BL
R281N5NOVK03GV,B07T5GGR8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Simple - sounds good - speech enhancement works.,Photomagica,5,"I plugged this into a TV with HDMI Arc and it came on and has worked perfectly since. Speech enhancement works very well, though it adds a slight harsh quality to the sound. Still it is absolutely needed on the too many shows where the characters mumble or speak in near whispers. Of course YMMV depending upon your hearing.When I purchased this I did not know it came with screw sockets on the back to mount it on the wall and a template to mark the wall for mounting. So - I put two screws in the wall under the TV and done. Nice!I found that the sound is better with the bar on the wall - the wide face facing the viewers - rather than narrow edge-on sitting on a console under the TV. I also tried it edge-on above the TV and this was slightly worse than edge-on under the TV. The differences weren't huge, just noticeable.Is this as good as a A/V receiver with multiple high quality speakers? (I have a system like that too.) No! That said, it does a a good job and produces pleasing sound with the small caveat that speech enhancement should only be used when needed.Is this very noticeably better than the sound from the TV itself? Hugely better!","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2020",AG47KMS65QDQRVG4ZG3AJEFMKFHA,True,2,Style: YAS-109BL
RPOHWVOVCDSJ,B07T5GGR8L,3.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not great soundbar,R. Johnson,3,"I did a lot of research on soundbars when I moved into an apartment and needed a compact yet great sounding system. I was hoping a soundbar would be the solution. I was very disappointed with virtually every soundbar I saw reviewed but thought that this Yamaha would be a moderately priced solution that sounded great. What I found is I have a decent soundbar that frankly doesn't sound better than my initial purchase of a low-cost soundbar at 25% of the cost. The system was not easy to set up, had to call support as the instructions that came with did not match what I was told on the phone and found online. The sound is decent, but not impressive at all unless you crank it up to a level I can't do in an apartment building. If you are directly in front of the bar, it sounds better, but even in my very small living room, I find if you are at the side you really loose the bass and treble highlights (can't fill the room). And after having only 3 weeks I already had it lose its configuration that took quite some time to set up and had to start over to re-set-up. I can't say it is horrible, but really wish I had never purchased it and could use the money I invested in a better solution (if I can find it).","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2019",AEVIKJVCZPTA4ZGQ2WOVZRTAX47A,True,34,Style: YAS-109BL
